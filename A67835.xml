            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And to his own further diſgrace, upon Feſtival dayes uſed him for a footſtool to tread upon when he mounted to horſe, and at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times ſcornfully feed him like a Dog, with crumes fallen from his Table. A rare example of the uncertainty of worldly honour, that he unto whoſe ambitious mind <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> two great parts of the world were too little, should be now carried up and down cooped up in a little Iron Cage, like ſome perillous wild beaſt; all which <hi>Tamerlane</hi> did not ſo much for the hatred to the man, as to manifeſt the juſt judgement of God againſt the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant folly of the proud.

               <p>After the death of <hi>VVilliam Sawtre</hi> was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended one <hi>John Badby</hi> a Taylor, a Lay-man, he was accuſed of hereſie and other Articles repugnant to the determination of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> before <hi>Thomas Arundell</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and other his aſſiants, both Lords Spirituall and Temporall, and was condemned for an Heritick, and delivered over to the Secular power to be burnt, the Kings warrand is given for his burning, he is brought into Smithfield, and there being put in an empty Barrell, was bound with Iron Chains faſtened to an Stake, having dry
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34119:11"/>Wood put about him. And as he was thus ſtanding in the Pipe or Tun, it happened that the Prince, the Kings eldeſt ſon was there preſent, who ſhewing ſome part of the good <hi>Samaritan,</hi> began to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and eſſay how to ſave his life, he admoniſhed &amp; counſelled him, that having reſpect unto himſelf, he would ſpeedily withdrawn himſelf out of theſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Labyrinths of opinions, adding oftentimes threatnings, the which might have daunted any mans ſtomack, but hee hearkened not thereunto, and then was the Tun put over him, and fire put unto him; and when he felt the fire, he cryed, mercy, calling belike unto the Lord, and ſo the Prince immedialy commanded to take away the Tun and quench the fire: The Prince his commandement being done, asked him if he would forſake Hereſie to take him to the faith of Holy Church, which thing if he would do he ſhould have Goods enough, promiſing alſo unto him a yearly Stipend out of the Kings Treaſury ſo much as ſhould ſuffice his contentation, but this valiant Champion of Chriſt neglecting the Princes fair words and promiſes, continued conſtant in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; then the Prince commanded him ſtraight to be put again into the Pipe or Tun, and that he ſhould not afterward look for any grace or favour, and ſo he was burnt to death. Other ſervants of God good &amp; religious men were accuſed of Hereſie, and brought before the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as <hi>VVilliam Thorp,</hi> who gave a large and notable confeſſion of his Faith, and anſwered wiſely and godly to all the points whereof he was accuſed by the Archbishop, where he ſuffered mocking and ſcorning and threatn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; what became of this good man, and bleſſed ſervant of God, is not at yet in Story ſpecified, by all conjecture, it is thought that the Archbishop <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Arundell</hi> being ſo hard an adverſary againſt him, would not let him go; much leſſe it is to be ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34119:12"/>that he would ever retract his ſentence and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he ſo valiantly maintained before the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, neither doth it ſeem that he had any ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canting ſpirit; Again, neither is it found that he was burned, wherefore it remaineth moſt likely to be true, that he being committed to ſome ſtrait Priſon (according as the Archbishop in his Examination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did threaten him) was ſo ſtraitly keeped, that either he was ſecretly made away, or, elſe there he died by ſickneſſe. The like end alſo I find happen to <hi>John Ashton</hi> another good fellower of <hi>VVickliff,</hi> he was condemned by the Bishops, and becauſe he would not recant, he was committed to perpetuall Priſon, wherein the good man continued till his death.</p>
               <p>And as great was the conſtancy of the true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, ſo many did shrink, and did revolt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce for danger of the Law.</p>
               <p>In thoſe dayes great was the pride and glory of the Clergie of <hi>England,</hi> that none durſt ſtir, or once mute againſt them, having the King ſo full on their ſide, armed moreover with Laws, Statutes, Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Impriſonments, Sword, Fire and Fagot, reigned and ruled as they liſted, as Kings and P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So ſtrong were they of power, that no humane force was able to ſtand againſt them, ſo exalted in pride, and puft up in glory, that they thought all things to be ſubject to their reverend Majeſties, whatſoever they ſet forth or decreed, it muſt be of all men received and obeyed: What greater shew of arrogancy and pride could there be then in this. When <hi>Thomas Arundell</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> paſſed by the high Street of <hi>London,</hi> and becauſe they did not ring their Bells for a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of his coming, took great ſnuffe thereat, and did ſuſpend all ſuch Churches in <hi>London,</hi> not only with the Steeple and Bells, but alſo with the Organs;

               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth had a Propheſie that he thould die in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and lying ſick in a fair

The like Propheſie we read of Pope <hi>Sylveſter</hi> 2. to whom being inquiſitive for the time and place where he should die, it was anſwered that he should die at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who then ſaying Maſſe in a Chappel (called likewiſe <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his end there to be near, and died.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>John Oldcaſtle</hi> the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> a moſt worthy and religious Knight was ſuſpect of Hereſie, and to bee a favourer and maintainer of <hi>VVickliffs</hi> Doctrine, and the profeſſors thereof, for the which he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and accuſed and falſly condemned for Hereſie. In his examination before the Archbishop <hi>Arundell</hi> and his Clergy, he anſwered wiſely and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly to every point he was poſed upon, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anent the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly and zealouſly maintained the Truth, but in end he is falſly and unjuſtly condemned as an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick. After that, the Archbishop <hi>Thomas Arundell</hi> had read the bill of his condemnation with moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity before the whole multitude, the Lord <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> ſaid with a moſt chearfull countenance, though ye judge my body, which is but a wretched thing, yet am I certain and ſure that ye can do no harm unto my Soul, no more then could Satan unto the Soul of <hi>Job,</hi> hee that created that, will of his infinit mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and promiſe ſave, I have therein no manner of doubt. And as concerning theſe Articles of my Belief that I have given in unto you, I will ſtand to them even unto the very death by the grace of my Eternall God. And therewith he turned him unto
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34119:13"/>the People, caſting his hands abroad, and ſaying with a very loud voice; Good Chriſtian people, for Gods love be well war of theſe men, for they elſe will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile you and lead you blindfold into Hell with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for Chriſt ſaith plainly unto you, If one blind man lead another, they are like both to fall into the ditch. After this he fell there down upon his knees, and thus before them all prayed for his Enemies, holding up both his hands and his eyes toward Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſaying, Lord God Eternall, I beſeech thee of thy great mercy ſake to forgive my perſewers if it be thy bleſſed will. And then he was delivered to Sir <hi>Robert Morley,</hi> and ſo led forth again unto the Tower of <hi>London</hi> there to be impriſoned, but he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped afterward out of the Tower, how and by what means it is uncertain, and was in <hi>VVales</hi> about the ſpace of four years, at which time a great ſumme of Money was proclaimed by the King to him that could take the ſaid Sir <hi>John Oldcastle</hi> either quick or dead, about the end of which four years being expired, the Lord <hi>Powes,</hi> whether for love or greedineſſe of the money, or whether for the hatred of the true and ſincere Doctrine of Chriſt, ſeeking all manner of wayes how to play the part of <hi>Judas,</hi> at length ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his bloody purpoſe and brought the Lord <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> bound up to <hi>London,</hi> and was brought before the Parliament, and being out-lawed in the Kings binch, and excommunicated before the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> for Hereſie, where he was adjudged that he ſhould be taken as a Traitour to the King, &amp; to the Realm: What was the point of Treaſon is not expreſſed, that he ſhould be carried to the Tower of <hi>London</hi> unto the new Gallows in St. <hi>Giles</hi> without Temple-bar, and there to be hanged and burned hanging, Treaſon was falſly ſurmized againſt him, his execution aroſe principally of his Religion which firſt brought him in hatred of the Biſhops, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops

Yet after the burning of the Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and prieſts were in great diſcredit, both with the Nobility and Commons, partly for that they had ſo cruelly handled the good Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> and partly again, becauſe his opinion, as they thought all at that time was perfect concerning the Sacrament. The prelats feared this to grow to further inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence toward them both wayes, wherefore they drew their heads together, and at the laſt conſented to uſe another practice, ſomewhat contrare to that they had done before, they cauſed by and by to be blown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad by their hyred ſervants, friends, and babling Sir <hi>John's,</hi> that the ſaid Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> was become a good man, and had lowly ſubmitted himſelf in all things unto the holy Church, utterly changing his opinion concerning the Sacrament, and thereupon they counterfeited an abjuration in his name, that the people ſhould take no hold of his opinion by any thing they heard of him before, and ſo to ſtand the more in aw of them, conſidering him ſo great a man, and by them ſubdued. At this time <hi>Thomas Arundell</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> died, and this may ſeem ſtrange, that the ſame <hi>Thomas Arundell,</hi> who a little before ſat in Judgement againſt the Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> and pronounced ſentence of death upon him, did him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf feel the ſtroak of death, and the ſentence of God executed upon him before the other, who would have

                  <hi>Teutonians</hi> (or <hi>Almains</hi>) in that Univerſity, ſeemed to carry away the praiſe and honour there in Diſputations above the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> they were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ashamed that ſtrangers should ſurmount them. It came to paſſe that one of the <hi>Bohemians</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the Books of <hi>VVickliff,</hi> communicated them to his companions, and they drew out of them great Arguments, which the <hi>Teutonians</hi> could not reſiſt, whereupon many diſſentions fell amongſt them, even to Batteries and Murthers: The <hi>Teutonians</hi> ſeeing this, forſook the place, in ſo much that more then 2000 Schollars on one day went out of <hi>Prage,</hi> and came to <hi>Lipſe,</hi> where they began an Univerſity after leave obtained. <hi>John Hus</hi> then had the greateſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, a man that came out of a Village called <hi>Hus,</hi> which ſigniſieth an Hen, whereof he took his name, he was of a great and quick ſpirit, and well ſpoken, beginning to recommend the Doctrine of <hi>VVickliff</hi> in his Sermons to the people; the occaſion how the Doctrine of <hi>wickliff</hi> came to <hi>Bohemia,</hi> was this, there chanced at this time a certain Student of the Countrey of <hi>Bohemia</hi> to be at <hi>Oxford</hi> one of a wealthy houſe,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:34119:15"/>and alſo of a noble ſtock, who returning home from the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> to the Univerſity of <hi>Prage.</hi> carried with him certain Books of <hi>wickliffs</hi> who being communicated to <hi>John Hus</hi> a man of great know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and of a prognant wit, took ſuch pleaſure in reading of them, that not only he began to defend this Author openly in the Schooles, but alſo in his Sermon commending him as a good man an holy and heavenly man, wishing himſelf when hee should die to bee there placed, whereas the Soul of <hi>wickliff</hi> should bee. The <hi>Bohemians</hi> being inſtructed with his Doctrine, began firſt to ſet againſt the Pope, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming him no more Honourable nor great nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bishops or Prieſts, and thereupon reformed the Doctrine by the concluſions and Articles following. Firſt, that the dignity makes not the Prieſt or Bishop honourable, but Sanctity of life and good Doctrine. 2. That ſouls ſeparat from the bodies, go right unto eternall pains, o ſtraight obtain happy life. 3. That there is no witneſſe in all the Scripture whereby can be proved that there is purgatory after this life. 4. To make oblation and Sacrifices for the dead is an inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the covetouſneſſe of Prieſts. 5. Images of God or Saints, benedictions of waters and ſuch like things are forged of men againſt the Word of God. 6. That the orders of begging Friers are invented by Devils. 7. That Baptiſme ought to bee adminiſtred with water without cream, oyle, ſpittle and ſuch polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 8. That the Temple of God is the world, That ſuch as build Churches, Monaſtaries and Oratories therein to incloſe him, do incloſe Majeſtie which is incomprehenſible. 9. That the Ornaments of Prieſts chaſubles, corporalls, chaleices, plates, veſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Altars, are all but vanitie. 10. That in vain we implore the help of Saints, and that it is time loſt uſing the Cononicall hours, 11. That faſtings, merit nothing 12. That the Euchariſt ought to be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34119:15"/>adminiſtred under both kinds 13. They rejected the Maſſe, and received only the communion of the Supper, the word and prayer and many other Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles draw from the holy Scripture.</p>

Then the Emperor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Lodovieus</hi> Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> which ſtood before him in his Robes, holding the Golden Apple with the Croſſes in his hands, that he should receive <hi>John Hus</hi> off the Bishops, and deliver him unto them which, should do the Execution, by whom as he was led to the place of Execution, before the Church doors he ſaw his Books burning, whereat he ſmiled and laughed: And all men that paſſed by he exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not to think that he should die for any error or hereſie, but only for the hatred and ill-will of his adverſaries, which had charged him with moſt falſe &amp; unjuſt crimes; all the whole City in manner being in Armour, followed him. When as he was brought to the place of Execution, he kneeled down upon his knees, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he prayed, and ſaid certain Pſalms, and eſpecially the 50. and 31.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:34119:17"/>ſaid, what he hath done before we know not, but now we ſee and hear that he doth ſpeak and pray very devourly and godly. In the mean time while he prayed, as he bowed his neck backward to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward unto heaven, the Crown of Paper fell off from his head upon the ground. Then one of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers taking it up again, ſaid, let us put it again upon his head, that he may be burned with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters the Devils whom he hath ſerved. When as by the commandement of the Torments he was riſen up from the place of his prayer, with a loud voice he ſaid, Lord Jeſus Chriſt aſſiſt me, and help me that with a conſtant and patient mind, by thy moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious help. I may bear and ſuffer this cruell and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious death whereunto I am condemned for the preaching of thy moſt holy Goſpel and Word. Then as before he declared the cauſe of his death unto the people, in the mean time the Hangman ſtripped him of his garments, and turning his hand behind his back, tyed him faſt unto the Stake with Ropes that was made wet. And whereas by chance he was turned towards the Eaſt, certain cryed out that he should not look toward the Eaſt, for he was an Heretick, ſo he was turned toward the Weſt. Then was his neck tyed with a Chain unto the Stake, the which Chain when he beheld, ſmiling, he ſaid that he would willingly receive the ſame Chain for Jeſus ſake, who he knew was bound with a far worſe Chain. Under his feet they ſet two Fagots, admixing Straw withall, and ſo likewiſe from the feet up to the chin, he was incloſed in round about with Wood. But before the Wood was ſet on fire, <hi>Lodovicus</hi> Duke of <hi>Bava<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ria,</hi> with another Gentleman with him which was the ſon of <hi>Clement,</hi> came and exhorted <hi>John Hus</hi> that he would be yet mindfull of his ſafeguard, and renounce his errours. To whom he ſaid, what er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour should I renounce when as I know my ſelf
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34119:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>guilty of none, for as for theſe things which are falſly alledged againſt me, I know that I never did ſo much as once to think them, much leſſe to preach them, for this was the principall end purpoſe of my Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, that I might teach all men pennance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins according to the verity of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt Jeſus, and the expoſition of the holy Doctors, wherefore with a chearfull mind and courage, I am here ready to ſuffer death. When he had ſpoken theſe words they left him, and ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hands together, they departed. Then was the fire kindled, and <hi>John Hus</hi> began to ſing with a loud voice, Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of the living God have mercy upon me. And when hee began to ſay the ſame the third time. the wind drave the flamme ſo upon his face that it choaked him, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he moved a while after by the ſpace that a man might almoſt ſay three times the Lords Prayer. When all the Wood was burned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, the upper part of the body was left hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Chain, the which they threw down ſtake and all, and making a new ſire, burned it, the head being firſt cut in Gobbets that it might the ſooner be conſumed into aſhes. The heart which is found amongſt the bowels being well beaten with ſtaves and clubs was at laſt pricked upon a ſharp ſtick, and roaſted at a fire a part untill it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed. Then with a great diligence gathering the ashes together they caſt them into the River of <hi>Rhine,</hi> that the leaſt remnant of the ashes of that man should not be left upon the earth, whoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory notwithſtanding cannot bee abolished out of the minds of the people, neither by water, neither by any kind of torment. And here is to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that notwithſtanding the Emperor had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed unto Maſter <hi>John Hus</hi> ſafe conduct that he might come freely unto <hi>Conſtance,</hi> but alſo that he
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:34119:18"/>should return again unto <hi>Bohem</hi> without fraud or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, yet the Emperor is forced by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of the Cardinals and Bishops, to breake promiſe, for ſaid they, that no defence could or might be given either by ſafe conduct of or by any other mean unto him which was ſuſpected or judged to be an heretick.</p>
               <p>Not long after followed the burning of that fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and learned man and godly Martyr of Chriſt Maſter <hi>Jerome</hi> of <hi>Prage</hi> burned at <hi>Conſtance</hi> for like cauſe and quarrel as Maſter <hi>John Hus</hi> was.

And finding no ſafe conduct to compare before the Counſel, the Nobles, Lords, and Knights ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Nation preſent in <hi>Conſtance</hi> gave unto Maſter <hi>Jerome</hi> their Letters, parents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed with their Seals for a teſtimony and witneſſe of the premiſſes, with the which Letters the ſaid Maſter <hi>Jerome</hi> returned again into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> but by the treaſon and conſpiracy of his enemies, he was taken and brought back again bound with fetters and

               <p>After his abjuration he returns to priſon where he is not ſo ſtraitly chained and bound as he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, notwithſtanding he is keeped every day with Souldiers and armed men; he is brought again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Counſell, where his enemies laid againſt him of new an hundred and ſeven Articles, to the intent he ſhould not eſcape the ſnare of death, which they provided and led before him, unto the which Articles moſt ſubtilly objected againſt him, he deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he held or maintained any ſuch Articles as were either hurtfull or falſe, and affirmed that theſe witneſſes had depoſed them againſt him falſly and ſlanderouſly, as his moſt cruell and mortall enemies; he revoked his former recantation that he had wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly conſented and agreed to the ſentence and judgement of the condemnation of <hi>Wickliff</hi> and <hi>Hus</hi> and that he had moſt shamefully lied in approving and allowing the ſaid ſentence; neither was he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to confeſſe that he lied, yea he did alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock and recant his confeſſion, approbation and proteſtation which he had made upon their condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, affirming that he never at any time had
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34119:19"/>read any errors or hereſie in the Books and Treatiſes of the ſaid <hi>Wickliff</hi> and <hi>Hus,</hi> &amp;c. The Counſell condemns him as an Heritick, and drowned in all kind of Hereſies, Excommunicat and accurſed, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him unto the Arbitrement and Judgement of the Secular Judge to receive juſt and due punishment according to the quality of ſo great an oftence. After he is condemned of the Counſell, he told them that his death would leave a remorſe in their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and a nail in their hearts, and ſaid he, <hi>Et cito vos omnes ut reſpondeatis mihi coram altiſſimo &amp; juſtiſſimo judice poſt centam annos,</hi> that is, And here I cite you to anſwer unto me before the moſt high and juſt Judge within an hundred years; as alſo, when the ſentence was given out againſt him, a great and long Miter of Paper was brought unto him, Painted about with red Devils, the which when he beheld and ſaw, throwing away his Hood upon the ground amongſt the Prelates, he took the Miter and put it upon his head, ſaying, Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt when as he ſhould ſuffer death for the moſt wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinner, did wear a Crown of Thorns upon his head and I for his ſake in ſtead of that Crown will will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly wear this Miter and Cap, Afterward he was laid hold of by the Secular power and brought forth to execution. When he was going out of the Church, with a chearfull countenance and loud voice lifting his eyes up to Heaven he began to ſing, <hi>Credo in unum Deum,</hi> as it is accuſtomed to be ſung in the Church. Afterward as he paſſed along, he did ſing ſome Canticles of the Church. After he came to the place of Execution, where Maſter <hi>John Hus</hi> had before ſuffered death innocently, kneeling down, he made a certain devour prayer: while he was thus praying, the tormenters took him up, and lifting him up from the ground, ſpoiled him of all his garments, and left him naked, and afterwards
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34119:20"/>girded him about the Loyns with a Linnen Cloath, and bound him faſt with cords and chaines of Iron to the picture of <hi>John Hus.</hi> which was made faſt unto the earth, and ſo ſtanding upon the ground when as they began to lay the Wood about him, he ſang <hi>Salve feſta dies,</hi> and when the Hymn was end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he ſang again with a loud voice, <hi>Credo in unum Deum</hi> unto the end. That being ended he ſaid unto the people in the <hi>Germane.</hi> Tongue in effect as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth. Dearly beloved children, even as I have now ſung, ſo do I believe, and none otherwiſe. And this Creed is my whole faith, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I die for this cauſe becauſe I would not conſent and agree to the Counſell, and with them affirm and hold that Maſter <hi>John Hus</hi> was by them holily and juſtly condemned, for I did know well enough that he was a true Preacher of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt. After that he was compaſſed with the Wood up to the crown of the head, they caſt all his garments upon the Wood alſo, and with a Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand they ſet it on fire; the which being once fired, he began to ſing with a loud voice, <hi>In manus tuas Domine commendo ſpiritum meam.</hi> When that was ended, and that he began vehemently to burn he ſaid in the vulgar <hi>Bohemian</hi> Tongue, O Lord God Father Almighty have mercy upon me, and be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto mine offences, for thou knoweſt how ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely I have loved thy truth. Then his voice by the vehemency of the fire was choaked and ſtopped that it was no longer heard, but he moved continually his mouth and lips as though he had ſtill prayed or ſpoken within himſelf. As he was burning in the ſire, they brought his bedding, his ſtraw-bed, his Boots, his Hood, and all other things he had in the Priſon, and burned them all to aſhes in the ſame fire. The which aſhes after that the fire was out they did diligently gather together and carry them in a Cart,

After <hi>Ziſca</hi> was dead their was great fear, ſorrow and lamentation in the Army, the Souldiers accuſing fortune which gave over ſuch an invincible Captain to be overcome with Death; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly there was a diviſion in the Hoſt, the one part chooſing <hi>Procopius Magnus</hi> to be their captain, the other part ſaying, that there was none could be found worthy to ſucceed <hi>Ziſca,</hi> whereupon they chooſing out certain to ſerve the Wars, named them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Orphans, and albeit that oftentimes there was diviſion between them, yet whenſoever any foraign power came towards them, they joyned their Powers together in one Camp and defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and prevailed mightily againſt their enemies.

But the <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians</hi> which were now become valiant victors in Arms, would not now be overcome with words; and ſo nothing being finally concluded, the Emperor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home.

An Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:34119:22"/>of three hundred Horſes was ſent unto <hi>Baſil,</hi> they compeared before the Counſel, and being heard they were demanded in what point they did diſagree from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they proponed four Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles; Firſt, they affirmed that all ſuch as would be ſaved, ought of neceſſity to receive the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Laſt Supper under the kindes of Bread and Wine. The ſecond Article, they affirmed all civill rule and dominion to be forbidden unto the Clergy by the Law of God. The third Article, that the Preaching of the Word of God is free for all men, and in all places. The fourth Article, as touching open crimes and offences which are in no wayes to be ſuffered for the avoiding of greater evill. Some were choſen by the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> and ſome by the Counſel, to conſider the Articles, and to diſpute them; this Diſputation continued fifty dayes, where many things were alledged on either part. In end, after long diſpute and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between the <hi>Bohemians</hi> and the Counſel, there was a concord and unity concluded between them. The Counſel permitted the <hi>Bohemians</hi> to Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate under both kindes as a thing lawfull by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Chriſt, and profitable and healthfull to all ſuch as duely received it. As for the other three Articles the <hi>Bohemians</hi> promiſed to receive the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the Church touching them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it ſetting to their hands; what the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination was of theſe three Articles I find it not.

               <p>In the year of God 1438. The noble Art of Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Letters made in Braſſe was found out, a very Divine Invention, worthy of memory and admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: yet were it more admirable if it ware not ſo much prophaned. The Invention was <hi>Germanick,</hi> and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:34119:23"/>very ſtrange at the beginning, and of great profit. <hi>John Gutemberge</hi> Knight was the firſt Author of this goodly Invention.

               <p>Now to leave the eſtate of the Church of <hi>Bohemia</hi> for a while, we return to ſpeak of the Perſecutions in <hi>England,</hi> and elſewhere, for if we will read and mark and take a view of the ſtirres that have been from time to time for Religion, we shall finde that in <hi>England</hi> is more burning and ſlaying for Religion, and more blood shed amongſt them then in any other Countrey or Nation in Chriſtendome beſides; and becauſe we cannot name all that hath been troubled and perſecuted amongſt them for Religion, we shall name ſome of the moſt memorable, And firſt of all in the firſt year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth his Raign, was burned the conſtant witneſſe-bearer and <hi>teſtis</hi> of Chriſts Doctrine, <hi>William Taylor</hi> a Prieſt under <hi>Henry Chichelie,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> for maintaining erroneous and hereticall Doctrine as they alledged, as that prayer ought to be directed to God alone, and to pray to any creature is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit idolatry.

               <p>Next, <hi>William White</hi> Prieſt, he was a follower of <hi>Iohn Wickliff,</hi> and a Prieſt, not after the common ſort of Prieſts, but rather reputed amongſt the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them whom the Wiſe-man ſpeaks, he was as the Morning Star in the midſt of a Cloud, &amp;c.

And thus this good man receiving the Crown of Martyrdome, ended this mortall life, to the great dolour and grief to all the good men of <hi>Norfolk.</hi> About this time alſo was burned Father <hi>Abraham</hi> of <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> and <hi>John Waddon</hi> Prieſt, for ſuſpected Hereſie.</p>
               <p>Many both men and women in thoſe dayes in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixt being ſuſpect of Hereſie or Lollaroy were apprehended and accuſed, and caſt into priſon, and greatly vexed, and after their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration brought into open ſhame in Churches and Markets; the form of the Popiſh pennance was this, three fuiſtgations or diſplings in proceſſion about the Cathedrall church three ſeverall Sundays, and three diſplings about the market place three principall market dayes, his head and neck and feet being bare, and his Body covered only with a ſhort ſhirt or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, having in his hands a taper of Wax of a pound weight, which the next Sunday after his pennance, hee ſhould offer to the Trinity, and that for the ſpace of three years after every Aſh wedneſday and Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day and thurſday he ſhould appear in the Cathedrall Church before the Biſhop or his Vicegerents to do open pennance among the penetentiaries for his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences.</p>
               <p>In the year of God 1430. ſhortly after the ſolemn coronation of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixt, a certain man named <hi>Richard Hoveden</hi> a woll-winder and a citizen of <hi>London</hi> was burnt for ſuſpition of Hereſie.

               <p>
                  <hi>Richard Wich</hi> Prieſt a man ſuſpect of Hereſie was degraded and burned at the Tower-hill.

               <p>Here is to be remembred the lamentable loſing of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> in the year of God 1453. <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus Palaeologus</hi> being Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> was taken by the Turk <hi>Mahometes,</hi> after the ſiege of fifty four dayes, which ſiege began in the beginning of

But the godly man after long exhortation heard, deſired the Sheriff to be content, for he was ſatisfied in his conſcience. notwithſtanding this he deſired of the Sheriff for Gods ſake to give him ſome meat, ſaying tha the was very ſore hungred. Then the Sheriff commanded him meat, whereof he took and did eat, as if he had been toward no manner of danger, and ſaid to ſuch as ſtood about him, I eat now a good and compleat Dinner, for I shall paſſe a little sharp showre ere I go to Supper; and when he had Dined he gave thanks, and requeſted that he might shortly be led to the place where he should yeeld up his ſpirit unto the Lord, and ſo he was burned.</p>

               <p>In the ninth year of the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh was burned a very old Woman above fourſcore years, named <hi>Joan Boughton,</hi> Widow and Mother to Lady <hi>Young,</hi> which Lady was alſo ſuſpect to be of that opinon that her Mother was, she was a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of <hi>Wickliff,</hi> and held ſo faſt and firmly eight

And in the mids thereof she cried to God to take her ſoul into his holy hands, and ſo she was burnt; he night following the moſt part of her ashes were had away of ſuch as had a love unto the Doctrine she died for. In the next year following was a Prieſt burnt which was ſo ſtrong in his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that all the Clerks and Doctors then there being, could not remove him from his Faith, whereof the King being informed, he cauſed the ſaid Prieſt to be brought before his preſence, who by his perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion cauſed him to revolt, and ſo he was burnt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly.</p>

In <hi>Italy</hi> one <hi>Thomas Rhedone</hi> a French-man and a Camelit Frier was burnt for the profeſſion of Chriſt at <hi>Rome.</hi> At this time alſo fell out the Martyrdome and burning of <hi>Hieronymus Savanatola,</hi> a man no leſſe godly in heart then conſtant in his profeſſion, he was a Monk in <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſingularly well learned, he Preached ſore againſt the evill life and living of the Spirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and eſpecially of his own Order, complaining ſore upon them as the Springs and Authors of all miſchiefs and wickedneſſe, &amp;c.

Of which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions diverſe were touching the matter of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: And when none was found in all <hi>Rome</hi> or in Europe that openly would Diſpute with him, privily and in corners certain of the Popes Clergy, Prelat, Lawyers and Friers by the Pope appointed, conſulted together to enquire upon his Concluſions, whereupon they did Articulat againſt him for ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hereſie: And thus the unlearned Clergy of <hi>Rome</hi> privily circumvented and intangled this learned Earl in their ſnare of Hereſie, againſt whom they durſt never openly Diſpute: he died being of the age of thirty two years, of ſuch wit and towardneſſe as is hard to ſay whither ever <hi>Italy</hi> bred up a better.

With two Popes, that is, with Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixt he had much vexation.

The manner of their burning on the cheek was this, their necks was tyed faſt to a Poaſt or Stay with Towels, and their hands holden that they might not ſtir, and ſo the Iron being hot was put to their cheeks, and thus bare they the Prints and Marks of the Lord Jeſus about them.

The door being opened and he admitted partly with the Pope, all others drew aſide, and the Pope and hee ſpake together as two uſe to do in ſecret cauſes, yet men may ſee a great and marvelous ſtrife and debate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them two, and that the Pope was not content, for he ſaid unto him, how goes this? My tearm is not accompliſhed, thou knoweſt that thy promiſe was 19. years, whereof I have brued but eleven and eight months Unto which words the Lucky hardly anſwered, yee underſtand not well the ſpeach, but are with it abuſed, for I ſaid not nineteen years as ye imagined, but I ſaid, yee ſhould remain Pope ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years and eight moneths, the which are come and paſſed, and therefore ye muſt needs die. But although the Pope was very active to require and to pray inſtantly that he would have regard to his life and to the tearm that he had granted him in his Popedome, yet it was as to ſpeak to a deaf man, and to plead in vain, for all his allegations, remonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, exceptions and requeſts profited nothing, ſo that they which were in the chamber and heard this marvelous debate and difference, might judge that Sathan was more expert in the Art of Arithmetick
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:34119:29"/>then the Pope was, and they might eaſily conclude that <hi>Alexander</hi> erred in his account; Finally to cloſe up the matter, even as Sathan went and departed from the place, in like manner alſo with great cryes, ſighs and fearful ſobs, the Popes ſoul (as it were) following his ſteps diſlodged and miſerably departed from his Body. This miſerably and ungodly died this Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> leaving to his Son his Seigniory altogether waſted and ruinous, and to the Italians their common-wealth all confuſed, perverted and waſted to the end hee might be a publick example to all ages how things evil gotten melt away, and are wickedly and unluckily ſpent. This Pope had with his ſaid Son a daughter called <hi>Lucretia,</hi> with whom both he and his Son lay, as <hi>Potantus</hi> and <hi>Samazarias</hi> have left written.</p>
               <p>Now to come to the Perſecutions that were in King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight his Raign. During the time and Raign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight there was great alteration of things as well to the civile State of the Realm, as eſpecially to the State Eccleſiaſticall and matters of the Church appertaining; for at laſt by him was exiled and aboliſhed out of the Realm the uſurped power of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> idolatry and ſuperſtition ſome what ſuppreſt, Images and pilgrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages defaced, Abbeyes and Monaſteries pulled down, Sects of Religion rooted out, Scriptures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the knowledge of the vulgar tougue, and the eſtate of the Church and Religion redreſſed.</p>
               <p>There was at this time a fierce contention which long before had troubled the Church, and now this preſent year 1509. was renewed afreſh between two certain orders of begging Friers, to wit, the Dominick Friers and the <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> about the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of Chriſt. The <hi>Franciſcans</hi> or Gray-fries held that the Virigin <hi>Mary</hi> prevented by the grace of the Holy Ghoſt,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:34119:30"/>was ſo ſanctified that ſhe was never ſubject one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in her conception to Original ſin. As for the Dominicks which were commonly called Black-friers or Preaching Friers held that he Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was conceived as all other Children of <hi>Adam</hi> be, ſo that this priviledge only belongeth to Chriſt to be conceived without Original ſin, not withſtanding the ſaid bleſſed Virgin was ſanctified in her Mothers womb, and purged from the Original ſin, ſo as <hi>John Baptiſt, Jeremiah,</hi> or any other priviledged per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. This frivolous Queſtion kindling and gender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between theſe two Sects of Friers bruſt out in ſuch a flame of parts and ſides taking, that it occupy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the heads and wits, Schooles and Univerſities al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt through the whole Church, ſome holding one part with <hi>Scotius,</hi> ſome the other part with <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> but in end Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> decided the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſent forth his Bull for the Conception of the Virgin to be without Original ſin.</p>
               <p>Having made mention of this Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fourth, It shall not be amiſſe to she what manner of Pope he was, he builded up in <hi>Rome</hi> a Stews of both kinds, getting thereby no ſmall Revenues and Rents unto the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> This Pope among other his Acts reduced the Year of Iubile from the fifty unto the twenty five: He alſo inſtituted the Feaſt of the Conception and the preſentation of <hi>Mary,</hi> and of <hi>Anna</hi> her Mother, and <hi>Joſeph.</hi> Alſo he Canonized <hi>Bonaventur</hi> and Sir Frances for Saints. By this <hi>Sixtus</hi> alſo Beads were brought in and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute to make our Ladies Pſalter, through the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of one <hi>Alanus</hi> and his order, whom Baptiſta maketh mention of in this Verſe, <hi>hi filo inſertis nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merant ſua murmura baccis,</hi> that is, theſe men putting their Beads upon a ſtring, number their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. This <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Pope made two and thirty Cardinals in his time, of whom <hi>Patrus Ruerius</hi> was
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:34119:30"/>the firſt, who for that he was Cardinal, which was but two years, ſpent in luxurious riot, waſted and conſumed two hundred thouſand Florens, and was left 6000. in debt. And what vile abominations this Pope permitted to this Cardinal and his Family to be done is unworthy to be named. <hi>Weſellus Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mugenſis</hi> in a certain Treatiſe of his <hi>de indiligentiis Papalibu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

After this <hi>Sixtus</hi> came <hi>Innocentius</hi> the eight, as rude and as far from all learning as his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors was before him. Amongſt the noble facts of this Pope this was one, that in the Town of <hi>Polus</hi> and <hi>Equicolos</hi> he cauſed eight men and ſix women with the Lord of the place to be apprehended and taken, and judged for Hereticks, becauſe they ſaid that none of them was the Vicar of Chriſt which came after <hi>Peter,</hi> but they only which follow the poverty of Chriſt. Alſo he condemned of Hereſie <hi>George</hi> the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and deprived him of his dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and alſo of his Kingdom, and procured his whole Stock to be utterly rejected and put down, giving his Kingdom to <hi>Mathias</hi> King of <hi>Pononia.</hi> Many godly perſons both men and women were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted for their Religion in the Dioceſs of <hi>London</hi> by <hi>Fitz James,</hi> and after him <hi>Tunſtal</hi> Biſhops of <hi>London,</hi> cruel perſecuters of Chriſts Church. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others, the chiefeſt objection againſt <hi>Joan Baker</hi> was that she would not only her ſelf not rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the Crucifix, but had alſo perſwaded a friend of hers lying at the point of death not to put any truſt or confidence in the Crucifix, but in God which is in Heaven who only worketh all miracles that be done, and not the dead Images that be but ſtocks and ſtones, and therefore ſhe was ſory that ever ſhe had gone ſo often on pilgrimage to <hi>St. Saviour</hi> and other Idols. Alſo that she did hold opinion that the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:34119:31"/>Pope had no power to give Pardons, and that the Lady <hi>Young</hi> her Mother, who was not long before that time burned, died a true Martyr of God, and therefore she wished of God that she her ſelf might do no worſe then the ſaid Lady <hi>Young</hi> her Mother had done. Unto <hi>William Pottier</hi> beſides diverſe other falſe and ſlanderous Articles, it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that he should affirm that there was ſix Gods, the firſt three was the Holy Trinity, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt; the fourth was a Prieſts Concubine being keeped in his Chamber the fifth was the Devil, and the ſixth the thing that a man ſetteth his mind moſt upon, The firſt part of his Articles he utterly denyed, confeſſing moſt firmly and truely the bleſſed Trinity to be only one God in one Unity of Deitie, as to the other three he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that a Prieſt delighting in his Concubine made her as his God, likewiſe a wicked perſon perſiſting in his ſin without repentance, and made the Devil his God. And laſtly, he granted that he once hearing of certain men which by the ſinging and chattering of Birds would ſeek to know what things were to come either to themſelves or others, and that theſe men eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Birds as Gods, and otherwiſe he ſpake not. Some were accuſed and challenged for ſpeaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Pilgrimages, praying unto Saints, that they denyed the carnall and corporall preſence of Chtiſts Body and Blood in the Sacrament of the Altar. And many were charged to have ſpoken againſt Pilgrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, and to have read and uſed certain <hi>English</hi> Books repugnant to the faith of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, and the four Evangeliſts, <hi>Wickliff, Wicket,</hi> a Book of the Ten Commandements of Almighty God, the Revelation of St. <hi>John,</hi> the Epiſtles of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> with other like, which theſe holy ones could never abide, and good cauſe why, for as darkneſſe could never agree with light, no more can ignorance

Moreover about the ſame time were certain articles objected againſt <hi>John Hig</hi> alias <hi>Noke,</hi> alias <hi>Johnſon,</hi> by the Biſhops vicar Generall amongſt which were theſe, firſt that he had affirmed that is was as lawful for a temporall man to have two Wives at once, as for a Prieſt to have two benefites. Alſo that he had in his cuſtody a book of the four Evangeliſts in English, and did often read therein, and that he did favour the Doctrines and oppinions of <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> openly pronounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Luther</hi> had more learning in his little finger then all the Doctors of England in their whole Bodies, and that all the Prieſts in the church were blind and had led the people the wrong way. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe It was alledged againſt him that he had denyed Purgatory and had ſaid, that while he were alive he would do as much for himſelf as he could, for after his death he thought prayer and almes deeds would little help him, theſe and ſuch like matters were they wherewi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In which rarity of books, and want of Teachers, this one thing may be much marvelled and muſed at, to note in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters, and to conſider how the word of truth not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding did multiplie ſo exceedingly as it did amongſt them, wherein is to be ſeen no doubt the marvellous working of Gods Almighty power, for ſo it is found and obſerved in conſidering the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, how one neighbour reſorting and conferring with another, oft ſeemed with a few words of the firſt and ſecond Table, did win and turn their minds to that wherein they deſired to perſwade them, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth of Gods Word, and their Sacraments.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:34119:33"/>their inquiſions and Examinations, that nothing was done or ſaid among theſe known men fifteen or twenty years before ſo covertly, but it was brought at length to their intelligence, as appears in a Table deſcribing the grievous afflictions of good Men and Women in the Dioceſſe of <hi>Lincolne</hi> under <hi>John Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> their Bishop, with the names both of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers and of them that were accuſed, alſo with the crimes to them objected out of the Regiſters of the ſaid Dioceſſe; all theſe were conſtrained to abjure and do penance, and they which were Relapſe, were committed to the Secular power and burnt.</p>
               <p>As touching the burning of <hi>John Scrivener,</hi> here is to be noted that his Children were compelled to ſet the fire unto their Father, in like manner as <hi>Joan Clerk</hi> alſo Daughter of <hi>William Tyleſworth,</hi> was compelled to give fire for the burning of her own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Father.

                  </gap>ubile with his Pardons abroad through all Chriſtian Realms and Dominions, whereby he
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:34119:34"/>gathered together innumerable riches and Treaſure. The Gatherers and Collectors thereof perſwaded the people that whoſoever would give ten shillings, should at his pleaſure deliver one ſoul from the pains of Purgatory, for thus they held as a generall Rule that God would do whatſoever they would have him, according to the ſaying, <hi>quicquid ſolveritis ſuper terram, erit ſolutum in Coelis,</hi> whatſoever ye looſe upon earth, the ſame shall be looſed in Heaven, but if it were but one jot leſſe then ten shillings, they preached that it would profit them nothing. This filthy kind of the Popes Merchandiſe as it ſpread through all quarters of Chriſtian Regions, ſo it came alſo to <hi>Germany</hi> through the means of a certain Dominick Frier named <hi>Tecellius</hi> who men impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently cauſed the Popes Indulgences or pardons to be carried and ſold about the Countrey. Whereupon <hi>Luther</hi> much moved with their blaſphemous Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous of this shameleſſe Frier, and having his heart earneſtly bent with arden deſire to maintain true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, published certain Propoſitions concerning Indulgences, and ſet them openly on the Temple of <hi>Wittemberge.</hi> This Frier and the reſt of the Monks there cryed out againſt <hi>Luther,</hi> that he was an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, and worthy to be perſecuted with fire. And beſides this, he burned openly <hi>Luthers</hi> Propoſitions, and the Sermon which he wrot of Indulgences. This rage and fumish fury of this Frier enforced <hi>Luther</hi> to treat more amply of the cauſe, and to maintain his matter. And thus roſe the beginnings of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, wherein <hi>Luther</hi> neither ſuſpecting nor dreaming of any change that might happen in Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, much leſſe ſuch a Reformation of Doctrine and Ceremonies as afterward did follow, did not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly reject the Indulgences, but required a moder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in them. The Duke of <hi>Saxonie</hi> at this time being very inquiſitive to underſtand the truth of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:34119:34"/>
                  <hi>Luthers</hi> Doctrine and conſulted the learned men thereupon. In the number of whom was <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> whom the Duke deſired to declare unto him his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion touching that matter of <hi>Martin Luther</hi> ſaying and proteſting that hee would rather the ground should open and ſwallow him, then hee would bear with any Opinions which he knew to be contrary to manifeſt truth; And therefore he deſired him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his judgement in the matter to him freely and friendly <hi>Eraſmus</hi> thus beeing entreated of the Duck, began thus jeſtingly and merrily to anſwer the Dukes requeſt, ſaying, that in <hi>Luther</hi> were two great faults, Firſt, that hee would touch the bellies of Monks; the ſecond, that hee would touch the Popes Crown, which two matters are in no caſe to be dealt withall. Then opening up his mind plainly to the Duke, thus he ſaid, that <hi>Luther</hi> did well in detecting er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and that Reformation was to bee wished and very neceſſary in the Church, and added moreover that the effect of his Doctrine was true, but only that hee wiſhed in him a more temperat moderation and manner of wryting and handling. <hi>Luther</hi> was condemned of the Pope as an Heretick, and rejected from the communion of the Faithful, he appealed to the Counſell to come. After this, <hi>Leo</hi> the Pope commanded that his Books ſhould bee burnt at <hi>Rome.</hi> And on the other ſide <hi>Luther</hi> burnt at <hi>Wittemberge</hi> his Canons, Popish decretals. And the Emperor by the Popes inſtigation was ordained to exile him, but he was kept ſecret and ſolitary for a time by the advice and conveyance of certain Nobles in <hi>Saxonie,</hi> In the abſence of <hi>Luther</hi> out of <hi>Wittemberge, Andre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Carolaſtadius</hi> proceeding more roughly and eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in cauſes of Religion had ſtirred up the people to throw down Images in the Temples beſides other things moe. For the which cauſe <hi>Luther</hi> returning again into the City, greatly miſliked the order of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:34119:35"/>their doings, and reproved the rashneſs of <hi>Carolaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adius,</hi> declaring that their proceedings herein were not orderly, but that Pictures and Images ought firſt to be thrown out of the hearts and conſciences of Men, and that the people ought firſt to be taught that we are ſaved before God and pleaſe him only by Faith and that Images ſerve to no purpoſe. This done, and the people well inſtructed, there was no danger in Images, but that they would fall of their own accord. Not that he repyned to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary (he ſaid), as thought he would mantain Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages to ſtand or to be ſuffered, but that this ought to be done by the Magiſtrat and not by force upon every mans head, and without order and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty &amp;c. The cauſe why <hi>Luther</hi> ſo ſtood againſt that violent throwing down of Images, and againſt <hi>Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtadius,</hi> ſeemeth partly to riſe off this, by reaſon this Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> in his Letters ſent to the Princes and States of <hi>Germany</hi> doth grievouſly complain and charge the Sect of <hi>Luther</hi> for ſedition and tumults and rebellion againſt Magiſtrats, and ſubverters and deſtroyers of all order and obedience as appeareth by the words of the Popes Letter, therefore <hi>Martin Luther</hi> to ſtop the mouth of ſuch ſlanderers, and to prevent ſuch ſiniſter ſuſpicions, was enforced to take this way as he did to proceed as much as he might by order and authority. <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> agreed in all points of Doctrine, ſaving in the Doctr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of the Sacrament; neither were there opinions ſo different in the matter of the Lords Supper, but that in the principal points they accorded. For if the queſtion be asked of them both, what is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall ſubſtance of the Sacrament which our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſes do behold and feel; they will both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe bread, and not the accidents only of bread: Further if the queſtion be asked whither Chriſt be there preſent, they will both confeſſe.

Again ask whether the materiall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance laid before our eyes in the Sacrament, is to be worshipped, they will both deny it and judge it Idolatry; and likewiſe for tranſubſtantiation, and for the Sacrifice of the Maſle, they both do abhorre and deny the ſame: As alſo the Communion to be in both kinds to be adminiſtred, they do both aſſent and grant. Only their difference is in this concerning the ſense and meaning of the words of Chriſt, <hi>hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> this is my body <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which words <hi>Luther</hi> exponneth to be taken nakedly and ſimply as the letter ſtandeth without trop and figure, and therefore holdeth the Body and Blood of Chriſt truly to be in the Bread and Wine, and ſo alſo to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with the mouth <hi>Uldricus Zuinglius</hi> with <hi>Joaunes Oecolampadius,</hi> and other moe do interpret theſe words, otherwiſe to be taken not literally but to have a ſpirituall meaning, and to be expounded by a Trope and Figure, ſo that the ſenſe of theſe words, This is my body thus to be expounded; this ſignifieth my Body and Blood The <hi>Saxons</hi> follow <hi>Luther,</hi> and the <hi>Helvetians Zuinglius,</hi> and as time did grow, ſo the diviſion of theſe opinions in ſides, ſpread in further Realms and Countries, the one part called of <hi>Luther,</hi> Lutherians, the other having the name of Sacramentaries. Notwithſtanding in this one unity of opinion, both the Lutherians and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentaries do accord and agree, that the Bread and Wine there preſent is not tranſubſtantiat unto the Body and Blood of Chriſt as ſaid, but is a true Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Chriſt. Many conflicts he had with the Pope, his Cardinals and Clergy, and notwithſtanding their furie and rage and plots againſt him, and the great power of his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, the Emperor and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Potentats, yet they could not prevail againſt him
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:34119:36"/>God keeping and defending him, that they could not bereave him of his life, but died peaceably in his own country where he was born, teaching and preaching Chriſt the ſpace of 29 years. Many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers he eſcaped, eſpecially theſe two which are not to be paſſed by, wherein appears the great providence of God toward him; Firſt, when a certain Jew by his enemies was appointed to come to deſtroy him by poyſon, yet was it ſo the will of God, that <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> had warning thereof before, and the face of the Jew ſent to him by picture, whereby he knew him, and avoided the perill. Another time as he was ſitting in a certain place upon his ſtool, a great ſtone there was in the Voult over his head where he did ſit, which being ſtayed miraculouſly, ſo long as he was ſitting, aſſoon as hee was up, immediatly fell upon the place where hee ſate, able to have crushed him all in pieces if it had light upon him. And what ſhould I ſpeak of his prayers which were ſo ardent unto Chriſt, that (as <hi>Melancton</hi> writes) they which ſtood under his window, where he ſtood praying might ſee his tears falling and dropping down. Again with ſuch power he prayed that he (as himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth) had obtained of the Lord that ſo long as he lived, the Pope should not prevail in his country. After his death (ſaid he) let them pray who could. Again, it is reported of him that a young man about <hi>Wittemberge,</hi> who being kept bare and needy by his Father, was tempted by way of Sorcery to bargain with the Devill or a familiar as they call him, to yeeld himſelf body and ſoul into the Devils power, upon condition to have his wish ſatisfied with money, ſo that upon the ſame, an Obligation was made by the young man written with his own blood and given to the Devill. Upon the ſudain, wealth and alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of this young man, the matter firſt being noted, began afterward more and more to be ſuſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpected,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:34119:36"/>and at length after long and great admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation was brought unto <hi>Martin Luther</hi> to be examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the young man, whether for shame or fear long denyed to confeſſe, and would bee known of nothing, yet God ſo wrought being ſtronger then the Devil that he uttered unto <hi>Luther</hi> the whole ſubſtance of the caſe as well touching the money as the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation <hi>Luther</hi> underſtanding the matter, and pittying the lamentable eſtate of the man, willed the whole congregation to pray, and he himſelf ceaſed not with his prayer to labour, ſo that the Devill was compell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the laſt to throw in his Obligation at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and bade him take it again unto him. And as he was mighty in his prayers ſo in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

God gave him ſuch a grace that when like preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they which heard him, thought every one his own temptations ſeverally to bee noted and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Whereof when ſignification was given unto him by his friends, and he demanded how that could bee; my own manifold temptation (ſaid he) and experiences are the cauſes thereof. For <hi>Luther</hi> from his tender years was much broken and exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſeverall conflicts, for he confeſſed that he was afflicted and vexed with all kind of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſaving only one which was with covetouſneſſe. With this vice he was never (ſaid he) in all his life to be troubled nor once tempted.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth of that name bare an irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliable heatred unto the Goſpel of the Kingdom of God, which he perſecuted in the perſon of <hi>Luther</hi> and many others: for as one day the Cardinal <hi>Bembo</hi> uttered before him a certain thing drawn from the Goſpel, he anſwered him mocking.

               <p>And firſt, there were two young men burnt at <hi>Bruxlies,</hi> the one named <hi>Henry Voes,</hi> being of the age of twenty four years, and the other <hi>Iohn Esh,</hi> which before had been of the order of the <hi>Auguſtine</hi> Friers, for that they would not retreat and deny their Doctrine of the Goſpel, which the Papiſts call Lutheraniſme. As they were led to the place of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, they went joyfully and merrily, making continually proteſtations that they died for the glory of God, and the Doctrine of the Goſpel, believing and following the holy Church of the Son of God, ſaying alſo that it was the day which they had long deſired. After they were come to the place where they ſhould be burned, and were diſpoyled of their
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:34119:37"/>garments, they tarried a great ſpace in their ſhirts, and joyfully embraced the Stake that they should be bound to, patiently and joyfully enduring whatſoever was done unto them, praiſing God with <hi>Te Deum laudamus,</hi> and ſinging Pſalms and rehearſing the Creed in teſtimony of their death. One of them ſeeing that fire was kindled at his feet, ſaid, me thinks ye do ſtraw Roſe, under my feet, finally the ſmoak and the flame mounting up to their face, choaked them.</p>
               <p>The next year after the burning of theſe two young men before rehearſed, was <hi>Henry Sutphen</hi> put to death by the conſpiracy of the Monks and Friers, without all order of judgement, or juſt condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: about the City of <hi>Diethmar</hi> in the borders of <hi>Germany,</hi> in the year 1524. they reſolved to take him by night and burn him, before the people should know it, as he came to his defence to anſwer. They with a confuſed multitude of people came unto him in the night, and drew him naked out of his bed, bound his hands hard behind him, and carried him away; then he being marvellous weary and faint re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be ſet on horſe-back, for his feet were all cut and hurt with the yce, becauſe he was led all night barefoot, when they heard him ſay ſo, they mocked and laughed at him, ſaying, muſt we hire an horſe for an Heretick, he shall go on foot whither he will or not, and after a world of indignities, mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſtriking and buſtetting him, he was burnt without any judgement, his cauſe not being heard. In the mean time a certain Woman as he paſſed by, offered her ſelf to ſuffer a thouſand ſtripes, and to give much money, ſo that they would pacifie the matter, and keep him in the priſon, untill that he might plead his matter before the whole convocation of the countrey people. When they heard theſe words, they waxed more mad, and threw the Woman
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:34119:38"/>down under feet, and trod upon her, and beat the ſaid <hi>Henry</hi> unmercifully; the fire as often as it was kindled, would not burn, notwithſtanding they ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied their minds upon him, ſtriking and pricking him with all kind of Weapons, the ſaid <hi>Henry</hi> ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the mean time in his ſhirt before all the rude people at the laſt they having gotten a great Ladder, bound him hard thereunto, and caſt him into the fire. And when he began to pray, and to repeat his Creed, one ſtrake him upon the face with his fiſt, ſaying, thou ſhall firſt be burnt, and afterward pray and prat as much as thou wilt. Then another treading upon his breaſt, bound his neck ſo hard to a ſtep of the Ladder, that the blood guſhed out of his mouth, and noſe. This was done to ſtrangle him withall, for they ſaw that for all his ſore wounds he would not die. After that with their weapons they had kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, they roſted him upon the coals, for the Wood as often as it was ſet on fire, would not burn out. And thus, this godly Preacher finished his Martyrdome, and many moe godly Preachers were burnt.</p>

Again to behold his patience, or rather the grace of God giving him the gift to ſuffer, it was a wonder. Thus quietly and conſtantly he endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his torments, pronouncing, or in a manner ſinging the Verſes of the 115.

               <p>A certain godly Prieſt in <hi>Suevia</hi> being commanded to come and give good counſell to ſixteen Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that ſhould be beheaded, afterward was bid himſelf to kneel down to have his head cut off, no cauſe nor condemnation further being laid againſt him, but only of meer hatred againſt the Goſpel.</p>

Alſo ſeeing a poor man coming by, as he went, that lacked ſhooes, he gave his ſhooes unto him; better, (ſaid he) ſo to do, then to have his ſhooes burnt, and the poor to perish for cold. Standing at the Stake, the Hang-man was ready to ſtrangle him before, but he would not, ſaying that there was no ſuch need that his pain ſhould be mitigated, for I fear not (ſaid he) the fire do therefore as thou art com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. And thus the bleſſed Martyr lifting up his eyes to Heaven in the middle of the flame, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tincted, to the great lamentation of all that ſtood by. After that time when the Friers of that City would go about for their Almes, the people would ſay, it was not meet for them to receive Almes with bloody hands. At this time alſo was great Perſecution in <hi>Gaunt</hi> and other parts of <hi>Flanders,</hi> as <hi>Charles,</hi> ths Emperor did lye in <hi>Gaunt,</hi> the Friers and Doctors there obtained that the Edict made againſt the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> might be red openly twiſe a year, which being obtained, great perſecution followed, ſo that there was no City nor Town in all <hi>Flanders,</hi> wherein ſome either were not expulſed, or headed, or condemned to perpetuall priſon, or had not their goods confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat, neither was there any reſpect of Age or Sexe.

And as for the day, he knew no other but the Sunday wherein he might not lawfully work for the neceſſity of his living, he is clapt into Priſon: word hereof coming to the Kings ears, the poor man was ſent for to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the King might have the hearing of him, who being come before the King, the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Petrus Caſtellanus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Maſcon</hi> to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion with him.

This done, this Tyrant more cruel then ever was <hi>Herod,</hi> commanded one of his Captains, with a Band of Ruffians, to go into the Church (where was a great number of Women, Children, and young Infants) to kill all whom he found there, which the Captaine at the firſt refuſed to do, ſaying that were a cruelty unuſed among men of War: Whereat <hi>Minerius</hi> being diſpleaſed, charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him upon pain of Rebellion and diſobedience to the King, to do as he had commanded him.

               <p>We are not here to paſſe by the fearfull Jugement of God that fell upon <hi>Minerius</hi> the cruel Perſecuter of thir innocents, being ſtricken with a ſtrange kind of bleeding at the lower parts, in manner of a bloody

               <p>It happened that <hi>John Martin</hi> of <hi>Briqueras,</hi> a mile from <hi>Angrogne,</hi> which vaunted every where that he would ſlit the Miniſters noſe of <hi>Angrogne,</hi> Was aſſaulted by a Wolf, which bit off his noſe, ſo that he died thereof mad.

               <p>As the Preſident of St. <hi>Julian</hi> comming to <hi>Angrog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi> to vex the people there, by the way he enquired for one dwelling at St. <hi>Johns</hi> near to <hi>Angrogne</hi> and examined him whether he had not baptized his child at Angrogne, and wherefore he had ſo done: The poor ſimple mans anſwered that he had baptized his child at Angrogne, becauſe baptiſme was there mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred according to the inſtitution of Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And here we ſee how the Papiſts play the Anabaptiſts. The poor man deſired the Preſident that he might be ſuffered to make his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to God before he ſhould make anſwer thereunto, which after he had done in the Hall before all the company there preſent he, required the Preſident that he would writ and ſigne it wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Preſident hearing this was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded that he ſpake not one word a good while after. Then ſaid he in a great fury, away thou vill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an out of my ſight, and after that he never was call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again any more.</p>
               <p>Barbarous was the cruelty that the enemies of the Goſpel did to a good Miniſter of St. <hi>German</hi> in the valley of <hi>Perouſe,</hi> they ſent a company of Ruffians by night who brought him out of his houſe and after ſore impri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In their cruel outrages againſt thoſe innocent peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the <hi>Waldoyes</hi> this is not to be paſſed by. A
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:34119:50"/>certain old man about threeſcore years of age, whoſe name was <hi>Odut Gemet,</hi> being apprehendit of them ſuffered a ſtrange and cruel death, for when they had bound him, they took all kind of beaſts, which live in horſe dung called in French <hi>Eſcarborz</hi> and put them unto his navel, covering them with a Diſh, the which within a ſhort ſpace, pierced into his belly and killed him. In that fight between the lord of <hi>Trinity</hi> &amp; the <hi>Angronguians</hi> there were burned about 1000 houſes of <hi>Angrogne.</hi> And here is not to be forgotten that they often times ſet fire upon the two Temples of <hi>Angrog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi> where the word of God was preached, but they could never burn them. A notable miracle of God in keeping the temples of the Goſpel from burning: So did they alſo to the Miniſters houſe, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding remained whole, the houſes round about, being all conſumed with fire. That day none of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grogne</hi> was ſlain or hurt, ſaving only one that was hurt in his thigh. There were in all <hi>Angrongne</hi> but two that were enemies to the word of God, which that ſame day were ſlain by the ſouldiers, not in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bat but for their riches they had about them as they were running away.

In end after many battels and conflicts there is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made up and agreed upon between the Lord of <hi>Raconis</hi> on the part of the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe their Maſter; and them of the valleys of <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> called <hi>Waldoyes</hi> through the mediation of the Dutcheſſe, The firſt Article is a promiſe of forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing armour againſt his Highneſſe. 2.

               <p>This accord being thus made and paſſed by the means of the Ducheſſe of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the poor <hi>Waldoys</hi> have been in quiet untill this preſent, and God of his infinit goodneſſe having delivered them out of ſo many troubles and conflicts, hath ſet them at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſerve him purely, and with quietneſſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>

Such was the blind rudeneſſe of that people, that they did impute this to the Divine vertue, as given that Croſſe from Heaven, for that it would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it ſelf to be worshipped of an Heretick and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly for the opinion of that great miracle, the multitude with their ſwords did hew it is pieces, every man thinking himſelf happy that might carry away ſome chip or fragment of the ſaid Croſſe. When he was come to the place where he ſhould ſuffer, the Friers were buſie about him, to have him recant, but he continued ever firm: As he was laid upon the heap of Wood, and the fire kindled about him, he began a little at the feeling of the fire to lift up his head toward Heaven, which when the Inquiſitors perceived, and hoping that he would recant his Doctrine, they cauſed him to be taken from the fire, but when they perceived nothing leſſe in him, the Adverſaries being fruſtrate of their expectation, willed him to be thrown in again, and ſo he was immediarly diſpatched. After that the Martyrdome of this bleſſed man was thus conſumat, the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors proclaimed openly he was damned in Hell, and that none ſhould pray for him, yea, and that all were Hereticks who doubted of his damnation, Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe certain of the Emperors Souldiers gathered of his aſhes.

                  <hi>Rochus</hi> at St. <hi>Lucar</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> was by his ſcience a Carver or grover of Images, who as ſoon as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan firſt to taſte the Goſpel, he fell from making ſuch Images as uſe to ſerve for idolatry in temples, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied himſelf in making ſeals, ſave only that he keeped ſtanding on his ſtall an image of the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> artificially graven for a ſign of his occupation.

To whom <hi>Rochus</hi> again, it shall be yours (ſaid he) if ye give me that which my labour and charges ſtand me in, but of that price I cannot afford it, yet had I rather break it in pieces, yea ſaith the Inquiſitor break it, let me ſee thee <hi>Rochus,</hi> with that he took up a chiſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

To whom <hi>Rochus</hi> cryed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain that he might do in his works what he liſted. And if the workmanship of the image were not after his fantaſie what was that to them.

To the heating of which ſentence, they had ordained in the ſaid Town there might be Theaters or Stages: Upon the firſt was placed Dame <hi>Jane,</hi> ſiſter to King <hi>Philip,</hi> and chief Regiment of his Realms: Alſo Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> King <hi>Philips</hi> ſon, with other Princes and Eſtates of <hi>Spain.</hi> Upon the other Scaffold mounted the Archbiſhop of <hi>Sivill,</hi> Prince of the Synagogue of the Inquiſitors, with the Counſel of the Inquiſition, alſo other Biſhops of the Land, and the Kings Counſel with them. After all were ſet and placed in great pomp, were brought forth (as a ſpectacle and triumph) the poor ſervants and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of Jeſus Chriſt, to the number of thirty, clothed with their <hi>Sanbenito</hi> as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> do call it, which is a manner of Veſture of yellow Cloath, comming both before them and behind them, ſpan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with red Croſſes, having burning Clerges in their hands, alſo before them was born a Crucifix covered with black Linnen-cloath in token of mourning: Moreover, they which were to receive the ſentence of death, had Miters of Paper upon their heads which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call <hi>Coracas:</hi> After this followed a Sermon made by a Dominick Frier, which endured about an hour. After the Sermon was finished, the Procurator Generall, with the Archbishop, went to the Stage where the Princes and Nobles ſtood, to Miniſter a ſolemn Oath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them upon the Crucifix painted in the Maſſe Book, the tennor, of which Oath was this, Your Majeſties ſhall ſwear that ye will favour the holy Inquiſition, and alſo give your conſent unto the ſame, and not

After the Oath, the Archbishop lifting up his hand, gave them his Benediction, ſaying God bleſſe your Highneſſe, and give you long life. In end the poor Captives &amp; Priſoners were called our, the Procurator-Fiſcall, or the Popes great Collector, firſt beginning with Doctor <hi>Cacalla,</hi> this Doctor <hi>Cacalla</hi> was a Frier of <hi>Auſtines</hi> Order, a Prieſt of the Town of <hi>Valedollid,</hi> and Preacher ſometimes to the Emperor <hi>Chrales</hi> the fifth, a man well accounted of for his learning, who, for that he was thought to be as the Standard-bearer to the Goſpellers (whom they called <hi>Lutherians</hi>) and Preacher and Doctor unto them, therefore he being firſt called for, whoſe ſentence was to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded, and preſently burned, and all his goods counſ cat to the profit and advancement of the Juſtice. Sentence was given out againſt the reſt, ſome put to pennance, whereof there were ſome Noble Perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, ſome to be condemned to perpetuall Priſon, and the moſt part to be burnt.

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:34119:56"/>that death was much more ſweet unto him with Teſtimony of the verity, then life with the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall of Truth and loſs of a good conſcience. Again <hi>Galeacius</hi> returned again to the defence of his former Doctrine with much more boldneſſe of ſpirit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Chriſt as he did before, and deteſted Images, affirming and proving that God only is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped, and that in ſpirit and verity. Alſo to be no moe Mediators but Chriſt alone, and that he only and ſufficiently by his ſufferings hath taken away the ſins of the whole world, and that all they which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part hence in his faith are aſcertained of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life; they which do not are under everlaſting damnation; with ſuch other like matter which was repugnant utterly to the Popes proceedings. His adverſaries perceiving that he in no caſe could be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, cauſed him to be committed to the Secular Judge to be burned. Thus <hi>Galeazius</hi> early in the morning being brought out of Priſon to the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, there was left ſtanding bound by the Stake till noon, as a gazing-ſtock for all men to look upon: In the which mean time many came about him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting him to recant, but nothing could ſtir the ſetled mind of this valiant Martyr, and ſo he was brought to the fire and burned. Touching the ſtory of this bleſſed Martyr, this by the way is to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for a Memorandum, that a little before this <hi>Galeazius</hi> should be burned, there was a controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie between the Major of the City and the Bishops Clergy for the expenſes of the Wood that should go to his burning, he hearing thereof, ſent word to both the parties to agree, for he himſelf of his own goods would ſee the coſt of that matter diſcharged. Another note moreover is here to be added, that while <hi>Galeazius</hi> was in captivity, certain of the Papiſts perceiving that <hi>Galeazius</hi> had great goods and poſſeſſins, practiſed with his wife, under colour
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:34119:56"/>to releaſe her husband, that she should lay out a ſum of money to be ſent to the wife of the chief Lord of <hi>Millain,</hi> called <hi>Ferrarius Gonzaga,</hi> to the end that ſhe should intreat both with her huſband, and with the Senat for <hi>Galeazius</hi> life: which money when they had thus jugled into their hands, <hi>Galeazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> notwithſtanding was burned, and ſo was the ſilly woman robbed and defeated both of her husband and alſo of her money.</p>
               <p>Doctor <hi>Mollius</hi> a Gray-frier for the teaching and profeſſion of the Goſpel of Chriſt Jeſus was four times impriſoned, and as oft delivered out of priſon, all the time hee remained conſtant in the defence of Chriſts goſpel, at laſt was brought with certain o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men (which were alſo apprehended for religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) into the temple of St. <hi>Mary</hi> at Rome either to revoke or to be burned. There ſate on them ſix Cardinals in high ſeats beſide the Judge, before whom preached a dominick-Frier, which cruelly inveying againſt the poor priſoners, incenſed the Cardinalls with all the vehemency he might to their condemnation, the poor man ſtood holding a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Taper in their hands, of whom ſome for fear of death revolted. But this Doctor <hi>Mollius</hi> with a weaver of <hi>Peruſium</hi> remained conſtant. Then <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> began an earneſt ſermon in the Italian tongue wherein he confirmed the articles of faith, by the ſacred Scriptures, declaring alſo that the Pope was not the ſucceſſor of <hi>Peter,</hi> but Antichriſt and his ſectaries do figure the whore of Babylon. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over he cited them up to the tribunal ſeat of Chriſt, and they being replenished with anger, condemned him with the weaver to the fire; and commanded them to be had away. So were they carried inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the camp or field called <hi>Florianum,</hi> where they remained chearfull and conſtant, firſt the weav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, was hanged. <hi>Mollius</hi> then willing the hangman

The people having diverſe judgments upon him, ſome ſaid he died an heretick, ſome ſaid he was a good man.</p>

                  </gap>e Cardinal of <hi>York,</hi> wherein is to be ſeen and noted the expreſs Image of the proud, vain glorious Church of Rome, how fare it differeth from the true Church of Jeſus Christ.</head>
               <p>THis Cardinall <hi>Volſey</hi> and the Popes Legat of <hi>Rome</hi> was ſo puft up in pride that he thought himſelf equal with the King. And when hee had ſaid Maſſe; he made Dukes and Earies to ſerve him of Wine with a ſay taken and to hold the baſen at the Lavatories. Furthermore as he was Ambaſſadour ſent to the Emperor at <hi>Eruxels,</hi> he had over with him the great Seal of England, and was ſerved with his Servitours, kneeling on their knees and many Noble men of England waiting upon him to the great admiration of all the <hi>Germans</hi> that beheld it, ſuch was his monſtruous pomp and pride. That glorious Cardinal in his tragicall doings did exceed ſo far all meaſure of a good ſubject, that he became more like a Prince then a prieſt, for although the King bare the ſword, he bare the ſtrok (making in a manner) the whole Realm to bend at his beck, and to dance after his pipe. Such practiſes and fetches, he had that when he had well ſtored his own Coffers, firſt he fetched the greateſt part of the Kings Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure out of the Realm in twelve great barrels full of gold and ſilver to ſerve the Popes wars. And as his avaritious mind was never ſatisfied in getting, ſo his reſtleſſe head was ſo buſie rufling in publick matters that he never ceaſed before he had ſet both <hi>England, France, Flanders, Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> together by the ears, for his pride and avarice he was hated of all men. At what time Pope <hi>Clement</hi> was taken priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, Cardinal <hi>Volſey</hi> wrote tot he Emperor to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:34119:58"/>make him Pope, but when he returned an anſwer, wherein he was not pleaſed, he waxed furious mad, and ſought all means to diſpleaſe the Emperor, write<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very sharply unto him many minacing letters, that if he would not make him Pope, he would make ſuch a ruffling between chriſtian Princes as was not this hundreth years before to make the Emperor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, year, though it should coſt the whole Realm of <hi>England.</hi> Whereupon the Emperor anſwering, biddeth him look well about him, leſt through his doings and atempts, he might bring the matter in that caſe that it ſhould coſt him the Realm of <hi>England</hi> indeed.</p>
               <p>The King finding himſelf deluded by Cardinal <hi>Campegius</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Volſey,</hi> anent the queſtion of his Marriage, the deciſion whereof was referred to them by the Pope but nothing in it by them done, <hi>Volſey</hi> tell from the Kings favour, ſo that after that time he never came more to the Kings preſence, for he was mightily offended with him whom he before ſo highly exalted and promoted to ſo many great dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, as to the Archbiſhoprik of <hi>York,</hi> the Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> of <hi>Durham,</hi> the Abbee of St. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bons,</hi> beſides the Chancelorſhip of <hi>England,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other high dignities and preferments in the Realm: He is deprived of his Chancelorship, and it is given to Sr <hi>Thomas More.</hi> There are ſundry Articles given in againſt the Cardinal, he is arreſted and brought up toward <hi>London,</hi> he fell ſick by the way, and by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderat Purgations killed himſelf. This was the end of this vain glorious Cardinal.</p>
               <p>It is recorded of one <hi>Humfrey Mummuth</hi> Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>London,</hi> much troubled for his Religion, a notable example of Chriſtian patience. In the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of Maſter <hi>Latimer,</hi> which the ſaid <hi>Latimer</hi> heard in <hi>Cambridge</hi> of Maſter <hi>George Stafford,</hi> Reader to the Divinity Lecture in that Univerſity, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:34119:59"/>the place of St, <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> that we shall overcome our enemie with well-doing, and ſo heap hot coals upon his head, brought in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, ſaying that he knew in <hi>London</hi> a great rich Merchand, (meaning this <hi>Humfrey</hi>) which had a very poor neighbour, yet for all his poverty he loved him very well, and ſent him money at his need, and let him come to his Table whenſoever he would. Now the Rich Man began to be a Scripture-man, he began to ſmell the Goſpel, the poor man was a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt ſtill. It chanced on a time when the rich man talked of the Goſpel at the Table, where he reproved Popery and ſuch kind of things: This poor man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there preſent, took a great diſpleaſure againſt the rich man, in ſo much that he would come no more to his houſe, he would borrow no more money of him as he was wont to do before-times, yea, and conceived ſuch hatted and malice againſt him, that he went and accoſed him before the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops. Now the rich man not knowing of any ſuch diſpleaſure, offered many times to talk with him, and to ſet him at quiet: It would not be. The poor man had ſuch a ſtomack that he would not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to ſpeak with him. If he met the rich man in the ſtreet, he would go out of his way. On a time it happened that he met him ſo in a narrow ſtreet that he could not avoid, but come near him, yet for all that this poor man (I ſay) had ſuch a ſtomack againſt the rich man, that he was minded to go forward and not to ſpeak with him. The rich man perceiving that caught him by the hand, and asked him, ſaying, Neighbour, What is come into your heart to take ſuch diſpleaſue with me; What have I done againſt you? Tell me, and I will be ready at all times to make you amends. Finally he ſpake ſo gently, ſo charitably, ſo lovingly and friendry, that it wrought ſo in the poor mans heart, that by and by he fell down upon his knees and asked him forgivenneſſe.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:34119:59"/>The rich man forgave him, and ſo took him again to his favour, and they loved as well as ever they did before. <hi>Agree with thine enemy while thou art in the way with him, Mat. 5.</hi>

               <p>Great was the courage and conſtancy of <hi>Thomas Bilney</hi> in his Martyredome. The night before his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution one of his friends comming to him, finding him at his repaſt with ſuch a chearfull heart and quiet mind, ſaid that he was glad to ſee him at that time, ſo ſhortly before his heavy and painful departure, ſo heartily to refreſh himſelf, whereunto he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Oh ſaid he I follow the example of the husband men of the countrey who having a ruinous houſe to dwell in, yet beſtow coſt ſo long as they may hold it up: And ſo do I now with this ruinous houſe of my body, and with Gods creatures in thanks to him to refreſh the ſame as ye ſee. Then ſitting with his ſaid friends in godly talk to their edification, ſome put him in mind, that though the fire which he ſhould ſuffer the next day, ſhould be of great neat to his body, yet the comfort of Gods ſpirit should coole it to his everlaſting refreshing. At this word the ſaid <hi>Thomas Bilney</hi> putting his hand toward the flamme of the candle barning before then (as alſo he did diverſe times beſides) and feeling the heat thereof, O ſaid he, I feel by experience and have known it long by Ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And I conſtantly believe that howſoever the ſtuble of this my body shall be waſted by it, yet my ſoul and ſpirit shall be purged thereby, a pain for a time, whereon notwithſtanding followes joy unſpeakeable. At the comming forth of the ſaid <hi>Thomas Bilney</hi> preacher out of the priſon doors, one of his friends came
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:34119:60"/>unto him and with few words as he durſt, ſpeak to him, and prayed him in Gods behalf to be conſtant and take his death as patiently as he could. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the ſaid <hi>Bilney</hi> anſwered with a quiet and milde countenance, ye ſee when the Mariner is entered his ship to ſail on the troublous ſea, how he for a while is toſſed in the billows of the ſame, but yet in hope that he shall once come to the quiet haven, he beareth in better comfort the perrels which he feeleth So am I now toward this ſailing, and whatſoever ſtorms I shall feel, yet shortly after shal my ship bee in the haven as I doubt not thereof by the grace of God, deſiring you to help me with your p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ayers to the ſame effect. And going forth into the ſtreets he gave much almes by the way, by the hands of one of his friends. Doctor <hi>Warner</hi> taking his leave of <hi>Thomas Bilney,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>paſce gregem tuum, paſce gregenituum ut cum venerit Dominus inveniat te ſic facientem</hi> that is, feed your flock, feed your flock, that when the Lord cometh he may find you ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Richard Byfield</hi> was degraded, kneeling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the higheſt ſtep of the Altar, the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> took his croſier ſtaffe and ſmote him on the breaſt, that hee threw him down backwards, and brake his head that he ſowuned, and when he came to himſelf again he thanked God he was delivered from the Malignant church of Antichriſt, and that he was come into the true ſincere church of Jeſus Chriſt Militant here on earth, and I truſt anone ſaid he to be in heaven with Jeſus Chriſt and the Church triumphant for ever, and ſo he was led to the fire in his apparell manfully and joyfully, and there for laik of a ſpeedy fire, was half an hour alive, and when the left arm was on fire and burned, he rubbed it with his right hand, and it fell from his body, and he continued in prayer to the end without moving.</p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:34119:60"/>
               <p>At the burning of <hi>James Baynham</hi> a Lawier, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a miracle and wondrous work of God, that as he was at the ſtake in the midſt of the flamming fire, which fire had half conſumed his arms and legs, he ſpake theſe words. O ye Papiſts, behold ye look for miracles, and hear now may yee ſee a miracle, for in this fire I feel no more pain then I were in a bed of Down, but it is to me as a bed of Roſes. Theſe words ſpake he in the midſt of the flamming fire when his legs and arms (as I ſaid) were half conſumed <hi>William Tracie</hi> a worshipful Eſquire in <hi>Gloceſter</hi> and then dwelling at <hi>Todingtown</hi> made in his will that he would have no funeral pomp at his burying, neither paſſed he upon maſſe, and he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid that he truſted in God only and hoped by him to be ſaved and not by any Saint. This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man died, and his Son as Executor brought the Will to the Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to prove, which he shewed to the Convocation, and there moſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly they judged that he should be taken out of the ground and burnt as an Heretick.

And as many were burnt at this time for the profeſſion of the truth, ſo multitudes both of men and women were compelled to abjure and recant, and to do pennance, and to bear faggots. So great was the trouble of theſe times, for either they were driven out of the Realm, or were caſt out from their goods and houſes, or brought to open shame by

The fame of this Jugler being much talked of, It chanced that as Maſter <hi>Tindal</hi> heard of it, he deſired certain of the Merchants that he might alſo bee preſent at Supper to ſee him play his parts. To be brief the ſupper was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and the Merchants with <hi>Tindall,</hi> were there preſent. Then the Juglar being required to play his feats, and to ſhew his cunning, after his

At the laſt with his labour, ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and toyling, when he ſaw that nothing would go forward, but that all his enchantment were void, he was compelled openly to confeſſe that there was ſome man preſent at Supper which diſturbed and ſetted all his doings. So that a man even in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs of theſe dayes cannot lack the miracles of true faith, if miracles were now to be deſired.</p>

The words of this worthy and chriſtian Lady at her death were theſe, Good Chriſtian people I am come hither to die, for accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law, &amp; by the Law, I am judged to death and therefore I will ſpeak nothing againſt it, I am to accuſe no man nor to ſpeak any thing of that whereof I am accuſed and condemned to die, but I pray God to ſave the King and ſend him long to raign over you, for a Gentler, or more mercifull Prince was there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, &amp; to me he was ever a Good, a Gentle, and a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne Lord.

               <p>Secondly, that the Communion in both kinds is not neceſſary <hi>ad ſalutem,</hi> by the Law of God to all perſons, and that it is to be believed and not doubted of, but that in the fleſh under the form of Bread, is the very Blood, and with the Blood under the form of Wine, is the very fleſh, as well in parts as they were both together.</p>

After that I ſat two long hours reaſoning with my Lord Chancellor upon the bare floor, whereas he with many flattering words perſwaded me to leave my opinion, but my Lord God I thank his everlaſting goodneſſe gave me grace to perſevere, and will do (I hope) to the very end; then was I brought to an houſe and laid in a bed, with as weary and painfull bones as ever had patient <hi>Job,</hi> I thank the Lord my God therefore.

After he had done, he was put to the fire, and he abode three quarters of an hour in the fire, for it was ſlow in burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and thriſe it was kindled before he was conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In the midſt of the fire he prayed with a loud voice, Lord Jeſus have mercy upon me, Lord Jeſus have mercy upon me, Lord Jeſus receive my ſpirit, and theſe were the laſt words that he was heard to utter. But when he was black in the mouth and his tongue ſwollen that he could not ſpeak, yet his lips went til they were ſhrunk to the Gams, and he knocked his breaſt with his hands untill one of his arms fell off, and then knocked ſtill with the other, what time the fat water and blood dropped out at his fingers ends, untill by renewing of the fire his ſtrength was gone, and his hand did cleave faſt in knocking to the iron upon his breaſt. So immediatly bowing for wards he yeelded up his ſpirit.</p>

O mercifull God, what ſhal we poor ſcattered Lambs do? What shall come of this wicked world? Good Lord, ſtrengthen him and comfort him, with ſuch other moſt lamentable and pitious voices. And he cryed to them, I have Preached to you Gods word and truth, and am come

Coming againſt the Almes-houſe which he well knew, he caſt to the poor people money which remained of that good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had given him, in time of his impriſonment. As for his living, they took it from him at his firſt going to Priſon, ſo that he was ſuſtained all the time of his impriſonment by the charitable Almes of good people that viſited him; he is not permitted to ſpeak at his death, and therefore he kneeled down and prayed, and a poor woman that was among the people ſtepp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in and prayed with him, but her they thruſt away, and threatned to tread her down with horſes, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſhe would not remove, but abode and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him. When he had prayed, he went to the Stake and kiſſed it, and ſet himſelf in a pitch Barrel which they had ſet for him to ſtand in, and ſo ſtood with his back upright againſt the Stake, with his hands folded together, and his eyes toward Heaven, and ſo he continually prayed.

When <hi>Boner</hi> ſaw that by no means he could prevail with <hi>Tomkins</hi> to forſake the truth, he found out a cruel device, Firſt he burnt his hand at a Taper or wax-candle, ſuppoſing that by the ſmart and pain of the fire being terrified, he

               <p>At this time died Pope <hi>Julius</hi> third, a Porkish and blaſphemous Pope. Amongſt other pranks and deeds of this foreſaid Pope, this is alſo reported of

Upon a time when he was admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed of his Phyſitian to abſtain from all Swines fleſh, for that it was noyſome for his Gout, and yet would not follow his counſell, the Phyſitian afterward gave warning to his Steward or orderer of his dyet, that he ſhould ſet no more Pork flesh before him.

               <p>In the cloſe of the Examination of <hi>John Simpſon</hi> and <hi>John Audely,</hi> two Husband-men, is to be noted the ſudden fear of Bishop <hi>Boner</hi> and his Doctors, which was thus, there was aſſembled at that time a great multitude of people, that becauſe the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory was not able to hold them, they were fain to ſtand in the Church near about the ſaid Conſiſtory, waiting to ſee the ſaid priſoners when they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and hearing the Bishop ſay, Have him ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Simpſon,</hi> being in a rage at his ſtout anſwers, Have him away.

The ſtanders by anſwering, ſaid that there was like to be ſo tumult, for they were together by the ears. When the Bishop heard this, by and by his heart was in his heels, and leaving his ſeat, he with the reſt of that Court betook them to their legs, haſtning with all ſpeed poſſible to recover the door that went into the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:34119:74"/>Bishops houſe, but the reſt being ſomewhat lighter of foot then my Lord, did ſoon recover the door, &amp; thronging haſtily to get in, keeped the Bishop ſtill our, and cried, Save my Lord, ſave my Lord, but meaning yet firſt to ſave themſelves if any danger ſhould come; whereby they gave the ſtanders by good matter to laugh at the rediculous fear of <hi>Boner</hi> and his Doctors, and ſo thereafter thir two godly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <hi>Simpſon</hi> and <hi>Audely</hi> were burnt.</p>

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:34119:79"/>was now come to the ſight of the Stake, although all the night before praying for ſtrength and courage hee could feel none, ſuddenly he was ſo mightily replen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed with Gods holy comfort and heavenly joyes, that he cried out, clapping his hands to <hi>Auſten</hi> and ſaying in theſe words, <hi>Auſten</hi> he is come, he is come, and that with ſuch joy and alacrity, as one ſeeming rather to be riſen from ſome deadly danger to liberty of life, then as one paſſing out of the world by any pains of death.

Great was the conference and godly talk that was between them while they were in priſon. Mr. <hi>Ridley</hi> wrote many letters from the priſon, as a letter from him and his priſon-fellows unto Mr. <hi>Braidford,</hi> and his priſon-fellows in the Kings bench at <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark,</hi> and to many others. And beſides theſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his, diverſe other tracttations were written by him, partly out of priſon, and partly in priſon.</p>
               <p>As for Mr. <hi>Latimer</hi> that famous Preacher and worthy Martyr of Chriſt and his Goſpel, he was a long time a zealous and ſuperſtitious Papiſt, and in this blind zeal he was a very enemy to the profeſſors of Chriſts Goſpel, as both his. Oration made when he proceeded Batchelor of Divinity againſt <hi>Philip Melancton,</hi> and alſo his other works did plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare; but he through the goodneſs of God was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by Mr. <hi>Bilney</hi> unto the truth, ſo that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before he was an enemy, and almoſt a perſecuter of Chriſt, he was now a zealous ſeeker after him, howbeit as Satan never ſleepeth when he ſeeth his kingdom begin to decay, ſo likewiſe now ſeing that this worthy member of Chriſt would be a shrowd ſhaker thereof, he raiſed up his impious Impes to moleſt and trouble him. He wrote alſo many letters from the priſon. Touching the memorable acts and doings of this worthy man, amongſt many other, this is not to be neglected what a bold enterpriſe he attempted, in ſending to King <hi>Henry</hi> a preſent, the manner whereof was this.

Here the ſtanders by were all aſhamed, marvelled, were amazed, did look one upon another whoſe expectation he had ſo notably deceived. Some began to admonish him of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation, and to accuſe him of falſhood; briefly, it was a world, the Doctor beguiled of ſo great an hope: I think there was never cruelty more notably or better in them deluded and deceived, for it is not to be doubted but they looked for a glorious victory, and a perpetual triumph by this mans recantation, ſo the Papiſts were in a great chafe againſt him, he is plucked down from the Stage by Friers and Papiſts for the true confeſſion of his faith, he is led to the fire, when he is brought to the fire, he putteth his right hand which ſubſcribed, firſt in the fire, which he held ſo ſtedfaſt and immoveable (ſaving that once with the ſame hand he wiped his face) that all men might ſee his hand burned before his body was touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his body did ſo abide the burning of the flame with ſuch conſtancy and ſtedfaſtneſs, that ſtanding al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in one place, without moving of his body, hee ſeemed to move no more then the Stake to which he was bound, his eyes were lifted up unto heaven, and oftentimes he repeated his unworthy right hand ſo long as his voice would ſuffer him, and uſing oft

This <hi>William</hi> after he had been abroad from his houſe a certain ſpace for fear of perſecution, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his wife was brought to bed, repaired home to viſite her, as natural duty required, and to ſee his children, she being now delivered four dayes before.

In the mean ſeaſon while they lay thus incloſed in ſeverall priſons, the husband and the wife, the B. practiſes with the man, and made him believe falſly that his wife had recanted, and ſo perſwaded him likewiſe to recant, and ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly drew out a form of recantation, and ſo likewiſe promiſed to recant, he being permitted to go to his

               <p>After this there is abloody commiſſion given forth by King <hi>Philip</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> to perſecute the poor members of Chriſt: There were many ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and at one time 22. priſoners were ſent up together for Gods word to <hi>London</hi> from <hi>Colche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> all whom bloody <hi>Boner</hi> B. of <hi>London</hi> was mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have executed, by perſwaſion of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal he was ſtayed.

               <p>At <hi>Colcheſter</hi> there were three men and three wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men burned in the forenoon, beſides four other burned at afternoon.

Good people, as many of you as believe as I believe, pray for me. Note well this ſaying of hers. Then she came to the Stake and kiſſed it, and ſaid, welcome the ſweet croſſe of

After the Tormenters had kindled the fire to her, ſhe ſaid, my ſoul doth magnifie the Lord, and my ſpirit rejoyceth in God my Saviour. And in ſo ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe ſet her hands together, right againſt her breaſt caſting her head and eyes upward, and ſo ſtood having up her hands by little and little, till the very ſinews of her arms braſt aſunder, and then they fell, but she yeelded her life unto the Lord, and quietly as she had been in a ſlumber, or as one feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no pain.

Being before <hi>Boner,</hi> among other talk, he affirmed that he had been twiſe at <hi>Rome,</hi> and there had ſeen plainly with his eyes which he many times heard of before namely, that
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:34119:92"/>the Pope was the very Antichriſt, for there he ſaw him carried on mens ſhoulders, and the falſe named Sacrament born before him, yet was there more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence given unto him, then unto that which they counted to be their God, When <hi>Boner</hi> heard this, riſing up, and making as though he would have torn his garments, haſt thou (ſaid he) been at <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſeen our holy father the Pope, and doſt thou blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme him. After this ſort, and with that flying upon him, he plucked off a piece of his beard, and after making ſpeedy haſte to his death, he burnt him half an hour before ſix of the clock in the morning, becauſe the day (belike): ſhould not be far ſpent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had done a miſchievous deed.

               <p>Next after, the Martyrdome of Mr. <hi>Rough</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Congregation, ſucceeded in like Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:34119:93"/>the Deacon alſo of the ſaid godly company or Congregation in <hi>London,</hi> named <hi>Cuthbert Simſon,</hi> being committed to fire. This <hi>Cuthbert Simſon</hi> was a man of a faithfull and zealous heart to Chriſt and his true flock, inſomuch that he never ceaſed la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring and ſtudying moſt earneſtly, not only how to preſerve them without corruption of the Popish religion, but alſo his care was ever vigilant how to keep them together without perill or danger of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, &amp;c. And as Mr. <hi>Rough</hi> had a viſion of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf touching his afflictions, ſo had he of this Deacon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for he dreamed that he ſaw two of the Guard leading <hi>Cuthbert Simſon</hi> Deacon of the ſaid Congregation, and that he had the book about him, wherein were written the names of them all which were of the Congregation, whereupon being fore troubled and awaked, and called his wife to ſtrike light, for I am much troubled with my brother <hi>Cuthbert</hi> this night, and giving himſelf to read upon his book a while, he fell aſleep again: being aſleep, he dreamed the like dream again, and awaked therewith, he ſaid to his wife, my brother <hi>Cuthbert</hi> is gone. And as Mr. <hi>Rough</hi> was making himſelf ready to go to <hi>Cutbert</hi> to ſee how he did, in the mean time the ſaid <hi>Cuthbert</hi> came in with the book concerning the names and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the Congregation, to whom he ſaid he was fore troubled with him all night, and declared to, him his dream. After he had ſo done he willed him to lay the book from him, and ſo carry it no more about him, unto which <hi>Cuthber</hi> anſwered he would not ſo for dreams he faid were but fantaſies and not to be credited. Then Mr. <hi>Rough</hi> ſtraitly charged him in the Name of the Lord to do it, and ſo he left the book behind him. The next night following he had a dream of his afflictions, <hi>Simſon</hi> is apprehended and ſent to the Tower of <hi>London</hi> by the Counſel. And being there commanded to tell whom I did will to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:34119:94"/>come to the <hi>English</hi> ſervice, he anſwered he would tell nothing, whereupon he was ſet in a rack of iron the ſpace of three hours, then they asked him if he would tell them, he anſwered as before, then he was looſed, and carried to his lodging again. On the Sunday after he was brought into the ſame place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain before the Leivtenant and the Recorder of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and being examined, he anſwered as he ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, then the Leivtenant did ſwear by God he should tell, then they bind his two fingers together, and, put a ſmall arrow betwixt them, and drew it through ſo faſt that the blood followed, and the arrow brake. Then they racked himtwiſe, but he would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe. Now as touching this <hi>Cuthbert Simſon,</hi> this further is to be noted, that <hi>Eoner</hi> in his Conſiſtory, ſpeaking of <hi>Cuthbert Simſon,</hi> gave this teſtimony of him there to the people, ſaying, ye ſee this man (faith he) what a perſonable man he is, and after he had thus commended his perſon, added moreover; And as concerning his patience, I ſay unto you, if he were not an Heretick, he is a man of the greateſt patience that ever yet came before me, for I tell you, he hes been thriſe racked upon one day in the Tower, alſo in my houſe he hath ſelt ſome ſorrow, and yet I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee his patience broken, &amp;c. It is thought and ſaid of ſome that, that arrow which was grated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his fingers being tyed together, was not in the Tower, but in the Bishops H.B, he is condemned sad burns in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> and two other with him.

But immediatly after the fire was put to him, ſuch was the fearfull ſtroak of Gods juſtice upon this blaſphemous railer, that he was there preſently in the ſight of all the people ſtricken with a freneſie, who in his furious rage and madneſſe caſting off his shoes, with all the reſt of his cloaths, cryed out unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſaid, Thus did <hi>James Abbes</hi> the true ſervant of God, who is ſaved, but I am damned, and thus ran he round about the Town of <hi>Burie</hi> ſtill crying out that <hi>James Abbes</hi> was a good man, and ſaved, but he was damned, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>About this time at the beginning of the flouriſhing Raign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> was a Parliament ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned and holden at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> wherein was much debating about matters touching Religion, and great ſtudy on both parts imployed, the one to retain ſtill, the other to impugne the Doctrine &amp; faction which before in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time had been eſtabliſhed. But eſpecially here is to be noted, that though their lacked no induſtry on the papiſts ſide to hold faſt that which they moſt cruelly from time to time had ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and by all means practiſed to come by, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding was the providence of God at that time, that for lack of the other Bishops, whom the Lord had taken away by death a little before, the reſidue that there were left could do the leſſe.

               <p>At this time when <hi>Normond Gourlay</hi> and <hi>David Straton</hi> were put to tryal and condemned, were ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouned Sir <hi>William Kird, Adam Dayes Henry Kernes, John Stewart of Leith,</hi> with diverſe others, ſuch as Mr. <hi>William Johnſtoun</hi> Advocat, Mr. <hi>Henry Henderſon</hi> School-maſter of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> of whom ſome compeared in the Abby Kirk of <hi>Halyrudhouſe,</hi> and ſo abjured, and publickly burnt their Bills; the burning of the Bill was a ſign of recantation, others compeared not, and therefore was exiled.</p>

               <p>The Archbishop <hi>James Betoun</hi> committed the charge of the Church affairs to his Nephew the Cardinal, who ſucceded in his place, for he was ſickly himſelf, and not ſeen often abroad. In his time lived Mr. <hi>John Major, Hector Boeth.

This Dean <hi>Thomas Forret</hi> preached every Sunday to his Parishoners the Epiſtle or Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel as it fell for the time, which then was a great no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to ſee any man preach except a black Frier, or a gray Frier, and therefore the Friers envyed him, and accuſed him to be the B. of <hi>Dunkel,</hi> in whoſe Dioceſſe he remained, as an heretick, and one that shewed the myſteries of the Scriptures to the vulgar people in English, to make the Clergy deteſtable in the ſight of the people. The B. of <hi>Dunkel</hi> named <hi>George Crighton,</hi> moved by the Friers inſtigation, called the ſaid Dean <hi>Thomas,</hi> and ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, my Joy Dean <hi>Thomas,</hi> I love you well, and therefore I muſt give you my counſel how ye shall rule and guide your ſelf.

Then the B. began this counſel on this manner, my Joy Dean <hi>Thomas,</hi> I am informed that ye preach the Epiſtle or Goſpel every Sunday to your parishoners, and that ye take not the Cow nor the upermoſt cloath from your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishoners, which thing is very prejudicial to the Church-men, and therefore my Joy Dean <hi>Thomas,</hi> I would ye took your Cow and your upmoſt cloath or Mortuary as other Church-men do, or elſe it is too much to preach every Sunday, for in ſo doing ye make the people think that we should preach like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; but it is enough for you when ye find any good Epiſtle, or any good Goſpel that ſetteth forth the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the holy Church, to preach that, and let the reſt be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Thomas</hi> anſwered, My Lord, I think that
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:34119:102"/>none of my parishoners will complain that I take not the Cow nor the uppermoſt cloath, but will gladly give me the ſame, together with any other thing that they have, and I will give and communicate with them any thing that I have, and ſo my Lord we agree right well, and their is no diſcord amongſt us. And where your Lordship ſaith it is too much to preach every Sunday, indeed I think it too little, and alſo would with that you L. did the like. Nay, nay, Dean <hi>Thomas</hi> (ſaith my Lord) let that be, for we are not ordained to preach. Then ſaid <hi>Thomas,</hi> when your L. biddeth me preach when I find any good Epiſtle, or a good Goſpel, truely I have read the New Teſtament and the Old; and all the Epiſtles and the Goſpels amongſt them all I could never find any evil Goſpel, or any evil Epiſtle, but if your L. will ſhew me the good Epiſtle, and the good Goſpel, and the evil Epiſtle, and the evil Goſpel, then <hi>I</hi> ſhall preach the good and ommit the evil. Then ſpake my Lord ſtoutly, and ſaid, I thank God that I never knew what the Old and New Teſtament was (and of theſe words aroſe a proverb which is common in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ye are like the B. of <hi>Dunkelden</hi> that knew neither new nor old Law) therefore Dean <hi>Thomas</hi> I will know nothing but my Portuiſe and my Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call: Go your way; and let be all theſe fantaſies, for if ye perſevere in theſe erroneous opinions, ye will repent it when ye may not mend it. <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaid, I truſt my cauſe is juſt in the preſence of God, and therefore I peſſe not much what do follow thereupon; and ſo my Lord and he departed at that time. And ſoon after a ſummonds was directed from the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and the ſaid B. of <hi>Dunkelden</hi> upon the ſame Dean <hi>Thomas Forret,</hi> and upon two black Friers called Frier <hi>John Kello,</hi> and another call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Reverage,</hi> and upon one Prieſt of <hi>Striviling</hi> called <hi>Duncan Simpſon,</hi> and one Gentleman called <hi>Robert

At this time likewiſe were apprehended two of the Dioceſſe of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> the one named <hi>Jeremiah Ruſſel</hi> a gray Frier, a young man of a meek nature, quick ſpirit, and good learning; and one <hi>Alexander Kennedy</hi> who paſſed not eighteen years of age, one of excellent wit in vulgar poeſie. To aſſiſt the B. of <hi>Glaſgow</hi> in that cruell judgement, or at leſt to dip his hands in the blood of the Saints of God, were ſent Mr. <hi>John Lawder,</hi> Mr. <hi>Andrew Oliphant,</hi> and Frier Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſervants to Satan, apt for that purpoſe. The day appointed to the cruelty approaching, the two poor Saints of God were perſecuted before theſe bloody Boutchers. Grievous were the crimes that were laid to their charge, <hi>Kennedy</hi> at the firſt was faint, and gladly would have recanted, but while the place of repentance was denyed unto him, the Spirit of God, which is the Spirit of all comfort began to work in him, yea the inward comfort began to bruſt forth, as well in viſage as in tongue and word, for his countenance began to be cheerfull, and with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect joy upon his knees, he ſaid, O eternal God, how wonderfull is that love and mercy that thou beareſt unto mankind, and unto me the moſt catiff and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable wretch above all others: for even now when
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:34119:103"/>I would have denyed thee and thy Son our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, my only Saviour, and ſo have caſt my ſelf into everlaſting damnation, thou by thine own hand haſt pulled me from the very bottom of hell, and made me to feel that heavenly comfort, which takes from me that ungodly fear, wherewith before I was oppreſſed. Now I defy death do what ye pleaſe, I praiſe God I am ready. This godly and learned <hi>Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie</hi> railed upon by theſe godleſſe Tyrants, anſwered this is your hour and power of darkneſſe. Now ſit ye as Judges, and we ſtand wrongfully accuſed, and more wrongfully to be condemned, but the day shall come when our innocency shal appear, and that ye shall ſee your own blindneſſe to your everlaſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confuſion. Go forward and fulfill the meaſure of your iniquity. While that theſe ſervants of God thus behaved themſelves, variance ariſeth betwixt the B. and the beaſts that came from the Cardinal: for the B. ſaid, I think it better to ſpare theſe men then to put them to death, whereat the idiot Doctors offended, ſaid, what will ye do my Lord? Will ye condemn all that my Lord Cardinall and the other Bishops and we have done? If ye ſo do, ye shew your ſelf enemy to the Church and us, and ſo we will repute you, be ye aſſured. At which words the faithleſſe man afraid, adjudged the innocents to die according to the deſire of the wicked, and ſo they were burnt, conſtantly triumphing over death and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan in the midſt of the fire.</p>
               <p>The King at this time was ruled wholly by the Cardinal, and made a ſolomn vow that none should be ſpared that was ſuſpect of hereſie, yea although it were his own ſon, which put many into fear.</p>
               <p>The fearfull viſion which the King had by night much terrified him, that he withdrew his mind wholly from the extremities on which the Clergy had ſet him.</p>

               <p>The King died in the year of the Lord 1542. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overwhelmed with grief and paſſion for the loſſe of his Army received at <hi>Solway</hi> by the <hi>Englishes,</hi> he departed this life at <hi>Falkland</hi> in the 32. year of his age, ſome few dayes before he died, he had advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that his Queen was deliveaed of a daughter at <hi>Linlithow,</hi> at which time it is ſaid he bruſt forth in paſſion, ſaying, it came with a Laſte (meaning the Crown) and will go with a Laſſe, fie upon it, after which he was not heard to utter many words.</p>
               <p>The Earle of <hi>Arran,</hi> Lord <hi>Hammilton</hi> was choſen Regent and Governour of the Realm. At this time there was a certain act of Parliament made, giving priviledge to all men of the Realm of <hi>Scotland</hi> to read the Scripture in their Mother tongue and language, ſecluding nevertheleſſe all reaſoning, conference, convocation of people to hear the Scriptures read or expouned. Which liberty of private reading being granted by publick proclamation, lacked not his own fruite, ſo that in ſundry parts of <hi>Scotland</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by were opened the eyes of the elect of God to ſee the truth, and to abhor the Papiſtical abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

All theſe were condemned and judged to death, as <hi>Robert Lamb William Anderſon, James Hunter</hi> and his wife <hi>Helen Stirk</hi> and others, and that by an aſſiſe by violating as was alledged the act of Parliament in reaſoning and conferring upon the Scripture, for eating flesh upon the dayes forbidden, for dishonouring of images, &amp;c. There was great interceſſion made by the Town in the mean ſeaſon, for the life of theſe perſons afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named to the Governour who of himſelf was willing to have done that they might have been delivered.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:34119:104"/>But the Governour was ſo ſubject to the appetite of the cruel Prieſts, that he could not do that which he would, yea, they menaced to aſſiſt his enemies, and to depoſe him except he aſſiſted their cruelty, the men were hanged, and the women drowned. <hi>Robert Lamb</hi> propheſied of the ruine and plague that came upon <hi>David Beton</hi> the Cardinal thereafter.</p>

The congregation labours to pacifie the Q. Regents rage

The cruelty and malice of theſe enemies againſt Chriſts people hath been ſuch that to judge which of them moſt exceeded in cruelty of perſecution it is hard to ſay, but it may bee thought that the bloody and beaſtly tyrranny of the <hi>Turks,</hi> eſpecially above all the reſt incomparable, ſurmounteth all the afflictions and cruel ſlaughters that ever were ſeen in any age, or read of in any ſtory, in ſo much that their is neither Hiſtory ſo perfect, nor writter ſo diligent, who wryting of the miſerable tyranny of the <hi>Turks</hi> is able to expreſſe or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the horrible examples of the unſpeakable cruelty and ſlaughter exerciſed by theſe twelve Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish tyrrants upon poor Chriſtian mens bodies, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſſe of theſe later three hundreth years.

In which Hiſtory the foreſaid Writer record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth one memorable example of maidenly chaſtity, worthy of all Chriſtians to be noted and commended. The ſtory is told of the Pretors daughter of that City, who being the only daughter of her father, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be of an exceeding ſingular beauty, was ſaved out of the ſlaughter, and brought to <hi>Mahomet</hi> the <hi>Turk</hi> to be his Concubine. But she denying to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to his <hi>Turkish</hi> appetite and filthineſſe, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded forthwith to be ſlain and murthered, and ſo
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:34119:119"/>died she a Martyr, keeping both here faith and her body undefiled unto Chriſt her Spouſe. The like cruelty alſo was shewed upon them that keeped the Caſtle, and afterwards yeelding themſelves upon hope of the <hi>Turks</hi> promiſe, were ſlain every one. What should I ſpeak of the miſerable ſlaughter of <hi>Methone,</hi> and the Citizens thereof, dwelling in <hi>Peloponeſus</hi> who ſeeing no other remedy, but needs to come into the <hi>Turks</hi> hands, ſet the Barn on fire wherein they were gathered together, men, women, and Children, ſome women alſo with childe voluntarily caſt themſelves into the ſea, rather then they would ſuſtain the <hi>Turks</hi> captivity. Miſerable it is to behold, long to recite, incredible to believe all the cruell attempts, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſlaughters wrought by theſe miſcreants againſt the Chriſtians through all places almoſt of the world, both in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> but eſpecially in <hi>Europe,</hi> &amp;c.

Chriſtian captives of the Nobles of that City to be ſlain before his face. So in <hi>Methone</hi> after that his Captain <hi>Omares</hi> had ſent unto him at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> five hundred priſoners of the Chriſtians, the cruell tyrant commanded them all to be cut and divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder by the midle, and ſo being ſlain, to be thrown out into the fields.</p>

But never did countrey taſte and feel more the better and deadly tyranny of the Turks, then did <hi>Raſia</hi> called <hi>Myſia</hi> Inferior, and now <hi>Servia,</hi> where the Prince of the ſame Countrey being ſent for, under fair pretence of words and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to come and ſpeak with the <hi>Turk</hi> after he was come of his own gentleneſſe, thinking no harme, was apprehended, and wretchedly and falſly put to death, and his skin ſlain off, his brother and ſiſter brought

Briefly to conclude, by the vehement and furious rage of thoſe curſed catiffs: It may ſeem that Satan the old Dragon, for the great hatred he beareth to Chriſt, hath ſtirred them up to be the Butchers of all Chriſtian people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> inflaming their beaſtly hearts with ſuch malice and cruelty againſt the name and Religion of Chriſt, that they degenerating from the nature of men to devils, neither by reaſon will be rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor by any blood or ſlaughter ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>And now to ſpeak a little of the miſerable eſtate of the Chriſtian captives under the Turk. And here, Firſt is to be noted that the Turk never commeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Europe</hi> to war againſt the Chriſtians, but there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth after his Army a great number of brokers or Merchants, ſuch as buy men, and children to ſell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, bringing with them long chains in hope of great cheats. In the which chains they lock them by fifty and ſixty together, ſuch as remain undeſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſword, whom they buy of the ſpoils of them that rob and ſpoil the Chriſtian countries, which is lawfull for any of the Turks Army to do, ſo that the tent of their ſpoyl or prey (whatſoever it be) be reſerved to the head Turk, that is to the great Mr. Chief. Of ſuch as remain for Tith if they be aged of whom very few be reſerved alive, becauſe little profit cometh of that age) they be ſold to the uſe of husbandry or keeping of beaſts. If they be young men or women they be ſent to certain places there to be inſtructed in their language and Arts, as ſhall be moſt profitable for their advantage, and ſuch are called in their tongue <hi>Sarai,</hi> and the firſt care of the Turk is this to make them to deny the Chriſtian Religion and to be circumciſed, and after that they are appointed every one as he ſeemeth moſt apt, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the learning of their Laws, or elſe to learn the
